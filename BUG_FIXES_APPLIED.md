# Bug Fixes Applied - 2025-10-15

## Issue 1: JSON Parsing Failures in Station 4 ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Station 4 was failing to parse JSON responses from the LLM with error:
```
JSON parsing failed: Expecting ',' delimiter: line 83 column 6 (char 4060)
```

This was happening because the LLM was returning JSON with:
- Missing commas between array elements
- Trailing commas in objects/arrays
- Other common formatting errors

### Root Cause
The `json_extractor.py` utility was strictly parsing JSON without handling common LLM formatting mistakes.

### Solution
Enhanced `json_extractor.py` with automatic JSON sanitization:

**File Modified:** `/app/agents/json_extractor.py`

**Changes:**
1. Added `sanitize_json()` method that automatically fixes:
   - Trailing commas in arrays: `,]` → `]`
   - Trailing commas in objects: `,}` → `}`
   - Missing commas between objects: `}\n{` → `},\n{`
   - Missing commas between strings: `"\n"` → `",\n"`

2. Updated `parse_json()` to:
   - Try parsing JSON directly first
   - If it fails, automatically sanitize and retry
   - Log success/failure with detailed diagnostics
   - Only raise error if both attempts fail

**Code Added:**
```python
@staticmethod
def sanitize_json(json_string: str) -> str:
    """
    Sanitize common JSON errors from LLM responses.

    Fixes:
    - Trailing commas in arrays and objects
    - Missing commas between array elements
    - Unclosed strings (attempts basic repair)
    """
    # Fix trailing commas in arrays: ,] -> ]
    json_string = re.sub(r',\s*]', ']', json_string)

    # Fix trailing commas in objects: ,} -> }
    json_string = re.sub(r',\s*}', '}', json_string)

    # Fix missing commas between objects in arrays (common LLM error)
    json_string = re.sub(r'}\s*\n\s*{', '},\n    {', json_string)

    # Fix missing commas between string values
    json_string = re.sub(r'"\s*\n\s*"', '",\n    "', json_string)

    return json_string
```

### Impact
- **Station 4**: Should now successfully parse references and seeds
- **All Stations 1-5**: Benefit from more robust JSON parsing
- **Future Stations 6-10**: Will automatically benefit when optimized

### Testing
Run full_automation.py again and Station 4 should now parse JSON successfully.

## Issue 2: Station 3 Export Failure ✅ FIXED

### Problem
Station 3 was failing to export text summary with error:
```
Station 3 text export failed: 'AgeGuidelines' object has no attribute 'recommended_age_range'
```

### Root Cause
The `full_automation.py` script was trying to access fields that don't exist in the `AgeGuidelines` dataclass:
- ❌ `recommended_age_range` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `maturity_level` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `age_reasoning` (doesn't exist)
- ❌ `content_warnings` (doesn't exist)

### Solution
Updated `full_automation.py` to use the correct field names from `AgeGuidelines`:

**File Modified:** `/full_automation.py` (lines 576-595)

**Correct Fields:**
- ✅ `target_age_range` (string)
- ✅ `content_rating` (string)
- ✅ `theme_complexity` (string)
- ✅ `violence_level` (ViolenceLevel enum)
- ✅ `emotional_intensity` (EmotionalIntensity enum)
- ✅ `action_scene_limits` (List[str])
- ✅ `emotional_boundaries` (List[str])
- ✅ `sound_restrictions` (List[str])

**Before:**
```python
f.write(f"Recommended Age: {result.age_guidelines.recommended_age_range}\n")
f.write(f"Content Rating: {result.age_guidelines.content_rating}\n")
f.write(f"Maturity Level: {result.age_guidelines.maturity_level}\n")
f.write(f"Reasoning: {result.age_guidelines.age_reasoning}\n\n")

f.write("Content Warnings:\n")
for warning in result.age_guidelines.content_warnings:
    f.write(f"  • {warning}\n")
```

**After:**
```python
f.write(f"Target Age Range: {result.age_guidelines.target_age_range}\n")
f.write(f"Content Rating: {result.age_guidelines.content_rating}\n")
f.write(f"Theme Complexity: {result.age_guidelines.theme_complexity}\n")
f.write(f"Violence Level: {result.age_guidelines.violence_level.value}\n")
f.write(f"Emotional Intensity: {result.age_guidelines.emotional_intensity.value}\n\n")

f.write("Action Scene Limits:\n")
for limit in result.age_guidelines.action_scene_limits:
    f.write(f"  • {limit}\n")

f.write("\nEmotional Boundaries:\n")
for boundary in result.age_guidelines.emotional_boundaries:
    f.write(f"  • {boundary}\n")

f.write("\nSound Restrictions:\n")
for restriction in result.age_guidelines.sound_restrictions:
    f.write(f"  • {restriction}\n")
```

### Impact
- Station 3 text export will now work correctly
- Output files will show proper age guidelines details
- No more AttributeError exceptions

### Testing
Run full_automation.py and Station 3 should export successfully to text file.

## Summary

### Files Modified
1. `/app/agents/json_extractor.py` - Added JSON sanitization
2. `/full_automation.py` - Fixed Station 3 export field names

### Benefits
1. **More Robust**: Handles LLM JSON formatting errors automatically
2. **Self-Healing**: Attempts to fix common issues before failing
3. **Better Logging**: Clear diagnostics when issues occur
4. **Consistent**: All stations benefit from improved JSON parsing

### Next Steps
1. Test full automation run to verify fixes work
2. Continue with Station 6-10 optimization
3. Monitor for any new JSON parsing issues
