## 🔧 IN PROGRESS: Station 5 (Partially Done)

### Status
- ✅ YML config updated to request JSON
- ✅ JSON extractor import added
- ⏳ Parsing methods need replacement (11 methods remain)

### What's Left for Station 5
The station has **2 separate LLM calls** that need to be unified:
1. Style recommendations call
2. Season skeleton call

**Recommendation:** Combine into single LLM call that returns comprehensive JSON with all 4 sections (as shown in updated YML).

**Methods to Replace:**
1. `_parse_style_recommendations()` - 70 lines → Use `extract_json()`
2. `_parse_season_skeleton()` - Complex parsing → Use `extract_json()`
3. `_extract_macro_structure()` - Regex parsing → Direct JSON access
4. `_extract_episode_breakdown()` - Complex → Direct JSON array access
5. Plus 7 more helper methods

**Estimated Reduction:** ~450 lines (25%)

## 🎯 Completion Strategy

### Option 1: Finish Station 5 Completely
**Time:** ~1 hour
**Impact:** Remove ~450 more lines

**Steps:**
1. Combine 2 LLM calls into 1 (use updated YML)
2. Replace all 11 parsing methods with `extract_json()`
3. Remove helper methods (`_extract_section_content`, etc.)
4. Test with real LLM

### Option 2: Quick-Optimize Remaining Stations
**Time:** ~2-3 hours
**Impact:** Touch all stations 6-10

**Steps per station:**
1. Update YML to JSON (10 min)
2. Add `extract_json()` import (1 min)
3. Replace main parsing method (15 min)
4. Remove helper methods (10 min)
5. Quick test (10 min)

### Option 3: Hybrid Approach (RECOMMENDED)
**Time:** ~2 hours
**Impact:** Complete high-value stations

**Priority Order:**
1. ✅ Stations 1-4 (DONE)
2. ⚠️ Station 5 (75% done, finish it)
3. 🎯 Station 10 (Largest remaining - ~350 lines)
4. 🎯 Station 8 (Second largest - ~250 lines)
5. 🎯 Station 9 (Third - ~220 lines)
6. Station 6 & 7 (Smaller, ~270 lines combined)

This gives you **80% of the total benefit** with **60% of the effort**.

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Pattern is repeatable** - Same 4 steps work for every station
2. **JSON extractor is powerful** - One utility serves all stations
3. **YML-first approach** - Requesting right format beats parsing wrong format
4. **Incremental progress** - Station-by-station is manageable

### Challenges Encountered
1. **Station complexity varies** - Station 4 & 5 are much larger than others
2. **Multiple LLM calls** - Some stations (like 5) need architectural changes
3. **Enum parsing** - Need string matching for difficulty/rating enums
4. **Nested structures** - JSON makes this easier, but needs careful mapping

### Best Practices Established
1. Always use `extract_json()` utility
2. No fallbacks - trust LLM or fail fast
3. Update YML first, then Python
4. Remove ALL old extraction methods
5. Test each station before moving to next

## 📝 Quick Reference Commands

### Check Station Size
```bash
wc -l /Users/mac/Desktop/script/app/agents/station_*_*.py
```

### Find Extraction Methods
```bash
grep -n "def _.*parse\|def _.*extract" station_XX_*.py
```

### Test Station
```bash
python full_automation.py --test-mode --stations X
```

### Check Redis Output
```bash
redis-cli GET "audiobook:session_id:station_0X"

## 🎯 Next Actions

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Finish Station 5** - Complete the in-progress work
   - Unify 2 LLM calls into 1
   - Replace remaining parsing methods
   - Test
