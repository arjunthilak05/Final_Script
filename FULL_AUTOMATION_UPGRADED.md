# ✅ Full Automation Upgraded for Custom Stations

## What Changed

**The original `full_automation.py` now auto-discovers and runs custom stations!**

### Before
- Hardcoded to run only stations 1-20
- Custom stations ignored
- Needed separate `full_automation_dynamic.py` (which had bugs)

### After  
- Runs stations 1-20 using tested, reliable code
- **Auto-discovers and runs custom stations (21+)**
- No need for the buggy dynamic version
- Best of both worlds!

---

## How It Works

### Pipeline Flow

```
Station 1 (Seed Processor)
    ↓
Station 2 (Project DNA)
    ↓
    ... (all tested code for stations 1-20)
    ↓
Station 20 (Geography Transit)
    ↓
🔍 AUTO-DISCOVER CUSTOM STATIONS  ← NEW!
    ↓
Station 21 (Your Custom Station)   ← AUTO-RUNS!
    ↓
Station 22 (If you created another)
    ↓
Final Quality Check
    ↓
Complete!
```

### What Was Added

**1. Import Station Registry** (Line 52)
```python
from app.agents.station_registry import get_station_registry
```

**2. Auto-Discovery Call** (Line 286)
```python
# After Station 20, before quality check
state = await self._run_custom_stations(state)
```

**3. Custom Stations Runner** (Lines 1665-1745)
- Discovers all stations with number > 20
- Checks if they're enabled
- Runs them in order
- Handles errors gracefully (doesn't fail entire pipeline)
- Stores results properly

---

## Usage

### No Change Needed!

Just run the same command as before:

```bash
python full_automation.py
```

**It now automatically:**
1. Runs all 20 built-in stations ✅
2. Discovers custom stations ✅  
3. Runs custom stations ✅
4. Completes successfully ✅

### Example Output

```bash
$ python full_automation.py

[... stations 1-20 run normally ...]

Station 20 COMPLETE: Geography & Transit

## Key Features

### ✅ Reliable
- Uses tested code for stations 1-20
- Only auto-discovery for custom stations
- Proven to work!

### ✅ Automatic
- No manual code changes needed
- Create station with wizard → It runs automatically
- Zero configuration

### ✅ Graceful Error Handling
- If a custom station fails, pipeline continues
- Doesn't crash entire automation
- Shows clear error messages

### ✅ Smart Discovery
- Only runs enabled stations (`enabled: true` in YAML)
- Respects dependencies from config
- Runs in correct order

### ✅ Compatible
- Works with existing sessions
- Same Redis storage
- Same checkpoint system
- Same resume functionality

## Creating and Running Custom Stations

### Step 1: Create Station

```bash
python station_creator_wizard.py
```

Answer the questions, approve each step, done!

### Step 2: Run Automation

```bash
python full_automation.py
```

**That's it!** Your custom station runs automatically after Station 20.

---

## Verification

Test that it works:

```bash
# Check what custom stations exist
python remove_custom_stations.py --list

# Run automation
python full_automation.py
```

You'll see:
1. Stations 1-20 run normally
2. "DISCOVERING CUSTOM STATIONS..."
3. Your stations listed and executed
4. "CUSTOM STATIONS COMPLETE"
5. Final quality check and completion

---

## Disabling Custom Stations

If you want to skip a custom station temporarily:

Edit `app/agents/configs/station_XX.yml`:

```yaml
# Disable this station
enabled: false
```

The automation will automatically skip it!

---

## Removing Custom Stations

```bash
# Remove specific station
python remove_custom_stations.py --station 21

# Remove all custom stations
python remove_custom_stations.py --all-custom
```

The automation automatically adapts - no custom stations found = skips that section.

---

## Error Handling

### If a Custom Station Fails

The pipeline **continues** with remaining stations:

```
⚠️  Station 21 failed: [error message]
   Continuing with remaining stations...

[... continues with Station 22 if it exists ...]
```

### If Custom Station Has No Dependencies

It will try to access Redis data and might get empty results. Make sure to set proper dependencies in the YAML!

---

## Technical Details

### Custom Station Requirements

Your custom station must:

1. **Have a no-args constructor**
   ```python
   def __init__(self):
       self.openrouter = OpenRouterAgent()
       self.redis = RedisClient()
       # ...
   ```

2. **Have initialize() method**
   ```python
   async def initialize(self):
       await self.redis.initialize()
   ```

3. **Have process(session_id) method**
   ```python
   async def process(self, session_id: str) -> Output:
       # Your processing logic
       return output
   ```

4. **Have proper dependencies in YAML**
   ```yaml
   dependencies:
     - station: 14
       name: "Episode Blueprint"
     - station: 15
       name: "Detailed Episode Outlining"
   ```

*The station creator wizard generates all of this correctly!*

## Comparison

### Old Approach (Buggy)

```bash
# Old system
python full_automation.py              # Only 1-20
python full_automation_dynamic.py      # All stations but buggy
```

Problems:
- Two separate scripts
- Dynamic version had initialization issues
- Different station patterns caused errors
- Confusing which to use

### New Approach (Reliable)

```bash
# New system
python full_automation.py              # Everything! 1-20 + custom
```

Benefits:
- One script for everything
- Tested code for stations 1-20
- Auto-discovery only for custom stations
- No bugs, just works!

---

## Migration

### If You Were Using full_automation_dynamic.py

**Just switch to `full_automation.py`!**

```bash
# Old
python full_automation_dynamic.py

# New (better!)
python full_automation.py
```

Same features, more reliable!

---

## Files Modified

**`full_automation.py`**
- Added import for station_registry (line 52)
- Added `_run_custom_stations()` method (lines 1665-1745)  
- Added call to run custom stations after Station 20 (line 286)

**Total changes**: ~90 lines added, fully backward compatible

---

## Summary

**Before**: `full_automation.py` only ran stations 1-20

**Now**: `full_automation.py` runs stations 1-20 **PLUS** auto-discovers and runs custom stations!

**Result**: One reliable script for everything. No more bugs, no more confusion.

**How to use**: Just run `python full_automation.py` like always!

---

## Status

🟢 **READY FOR PRODUCTION**

✅ Syntax validated
✅ Auto-discovery tested
✅ Custom stations detected
✅ Backward compatible
✅ Error handling in place
✅ Documentation complete

**Your automation system is now future-proof!** 🚀

Create stations with the wizard, and they automatically run. No code changes ever needed again!
