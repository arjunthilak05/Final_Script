## 🎯 How It Works

### Creating a Station

```bash
python station_creator_wizard.py
```

1. Wizard asks questions about your station
2. AI generates professional descriptions and prompts
3. Files are created in `app/agents/` and `app/agents/configs/`
4. **Station is immediately ready to use!**

### Running the Pipeline

```bash
python full_automation_dynamic.py
```

**Automatically:**
- 🔍 Discovers all stations (including new ones)
- 📊 Shows pipeline with dependencies
- ⚡ Runs in correct order
- 💾 Saves checkpoints

**Example Output:**
```
🏭 PIPELINE EXECUTION ORDER
======================================================================
   1. Station 1: Seed Processor (no dependencies)
   2. Station 2: Project DNA Builder (depends on: 1)
   3. Station 3: Age Genre Optimizer (depends on: 2)
   ...
  21. Station 20: Geography Transit (depends on: 9, 15)
  22. Station 21: Your New Station (depends on: 8, 14, 15)  ← AUTO-ADDED!
======================================================================
Total stations: 22
```

### Dependency Resolution

The system automatically:
- ✅ Reads dependencies from YAML configs
- ✅ Builds dependency graph
- ✅ Uses topological sort to determine order
- ✅ Detects circular dependencies
- ✅ Ensures stations run after their dependencies

**Example:**
```yaml
# In station_21.yml
dependencies:
  - station: 8
    name: "Character Architecture"
  - station: 14
    name: "Episode Blueprint"
  - station: 15
    name: "Detailed Episode Outlining"
```

**Result:** Station 21 automatically runs after 8, 14, and 15!

---

## 🧪 Testing

The system was tested and verified:

✅ **Auto-Discovery**: All 21 existing stations discovered
✅ **Dependency Loading**: All dependencies correctly parsed
✅ **Execution Order**: Topological sort produces correct order
✅ **Dynamic Loading**: Station classes load at runtime
✅ **No Circular Dependencies**: Validation works correctly

Test results:
```
================================================================================
🎉 ALL TESTS PASSED!
================================================================================
✅ 21 stations discovered
✅ Dependencies resolved correctly
✅ No circular dependencies
✅ Dynamic class loading works
```

## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Example 1: Create a Music Station

```bash
$ python station_creator_wizard.py

Station name: Music Cue Generator
Purpose: Analyze emotions and suggest music
Type: Generation
Inputs: 8, 14, 15
Complexity: Medium

✅ Station created!
   Files: station_21_music_cue_generator.py
          station_21.yml
          test_station_21.py

$ python full_automation_dynamic.py

[Pipeline automatically includes Station 21!]
```

### Example 2: Disable a Station Temporarily

Edit `app/agents/configs/station_XX.yml`:
```yaml
enabled: false  # Station is skipped
```

Re-enable:
```yaml
enabled: true   # Station runs normally
```

### Example 3: Add Dependencies

Edit station's YAML config:
```yaml
dependencies:
  - station: 5
    name: "Season Architecture"
  - station: 8
    name: "Character Architecture"
```

**No code changes needed!** Just edit YAML.

## 🔑 Key Benefits

| Feature | Old System | New System |
|---------|-----------|------------|
| Add Station | Manual code edits | `python station_creator_wizard.py` |
| Integration | Edit 2-3 files | Automatic |
| Dependencies | Hardcoded order | Auto-resolved |
| Testing | Complex setup | Generated test script |
| Pipeline Changes | Risk of breaking | No code changes needed |

## 🚀 Next Steps

### To Create Your First Auto-Integrated Station:

```bash
# 1. Run wizard
python station_creator_wizard.py

# 2. Follow the prompts

# 3. Test your station
python tools/test_station_21.py

# 4. Run full pipeline (includes your station automatically!)
python full_automation_dynamic.py
```

### To Use Existing Features:

```bash
# Run full pipeline with auto-discovery
python full_automation_dynamic.py

# Resume interrupted session
python resume_automation_dynamic.py

# Disable a station: Edit station_XX.yml → enabled: false
# Re-enable: Edit station_XX.yml → enabled: true
```
