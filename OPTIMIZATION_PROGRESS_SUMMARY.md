## Shared Utilities Created

### `app/agents/json_extractor.py` (200 lines)
Provides standardized JSON extraction for all stations:

```python
from app.agents.json_extractor import extract_json

# Use in any station
data = extract_json(llm_response)
```

**Features:**
- Handles markdown code blocks
- Validates JSON structure
- Clear error messages
- Consistent across all stations

## Optimization Pattern (Proven & Repeatable)

### Step 1: Update YML Config
```yaml
prompts:
  main: |
    Return ONLY valid JSON:

    ```json
    {
      "field1": "value",
      "field2": ["array", "values"],
      "field3": {
        "nested": "object"
      }
    }
    ```

    CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON.
```

### Step 2: Add JSON Import
```python
from app.agents.json_extractor import extract_json
```

### Step 3: Create Unified Parsing Method
```python
def _parse_llm_response(self, response: str) -> OutputDataclass:
    try:
        data = extract_json(response)

        return OutputDataclass(
            field1=data.get("field1", "default"),
            field2=data.get("field2", []),
            field3=NestedClass(**data.get("field3", {}))
        )
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Parsing failed: {str(e)}")
        raise
```

### Step 4: Remove Old Methods
- Search for all `_extract_*()` methods
- Search for all `_parse_*()` helpers
- Remove regex-based parsing
- Remove fallback logic
- Clean up imports

### Step 5: Test Thoroughly
- Unit tests for JSON parsing
- Integration tests with previous stations
- Error handling tests
- Redis storage verification

## Project Goals

**Original Request:**
> "these are the things do be done till station 10, now i was using a low leveel llm before so the llm respoce wwas bad so due to that i mad a lot of extracting or like big a lot of number of line code s now i think thise things are unwatned and heavae so i need you to go through all of those and remove unwanted make it oerfect precise and perfect"

**Progress:**
- âœ… Stations 1-5: COMPLETE (50%)
- ðŸ”„ Stations 6-10: IN PROGRESS (50%)

**Expected Final Results:**
- Total line reduction: ~3,400 lines (40% reduction)
- Total methods removed: ~75 methods
- LLM quality: Leveraging GLM-4.5 and other high-quality models
- Code quality: Clean, maintainable, precise

Ready to continue with Station 6 when requested.

**Files to modify:**
- `app/agents/station_06_master_style_guide.py`
- `app/agents/configs/station_6.yml`

**Expected outcome:**
