# ✅ Resume Automation Updated for Custom Stations

## What Was Changed

Updated `resume_automation.py` to support custom stations (21+) just like `full_automation.py`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Imports (Lines 30-35)
```python
from app.agents.station_16_canon_check import Station16CanonCheck
from app.agents.station_17_dialect_planning import Station17DialectPlanning
from app.agents.station_18_evergreen_check import Station18EvergreenCheck
from app.agents.station_19_procedure_check import Station19ProcedureCheck
from app.agents.station_20_geography_transit import Station20GeographyTransit
from app.agents.station_registry import get_station_registry
```

### 2. Added Custom Station Handling (Lines 238-265)
```python
# Handle custom stations (21+) created with station_creator_wizard
elif station_num > 20:
    registry = get_station_registry()
    metadata = registry.get_station_metadata(station_num)
    
    # Dynamically load and run custom station
    StationClass = registry.load_station_class(station_num)
    station = StationClass()
    await station.initialize()
    result = await station.process(session_id)
    print(f"✅ Station {station_num} completed: {metadata.name}")
```

### 3. Auto-Discovery in Main (Lines 343-355)
```python
# Auto-discover all available stations (including custom ones)
registry = get_station_registry()
all_stations = registry.get_all_stations()
valid_stations = sorted([num for num in all_stations.keys() if all_stations[num].enabled])

# Show custom stations if any exist
custom_stations = [num for num in valid_stations if num > 20]
if custom_stations:
    print(f"\n📦 CUSTOM STATIONS AVAILABLE:")
    for num in custom_stations:
        meta = all_stations[num]
        print(f"   • Station {num}: {meta.name}")
```

### 4. Run All Stations Including Custom (Lines 374-383)
```python
# Find remaining stations to run (includes custom stations)
remaining_stations = [s for s in valid_stations if s >= resume_station]

print(f"📊 Will run {len(remaining_stations)} station(s): {remaining_stations}")

# Run all (including custom stations after 20)
for current_station in remaining_stations:
    success = await run_station(current_station, session_id)
```

### 5. Updated Completion Message (Lines 395-405)
```python
# Check if this is the last station
if current_station == remaining_stations[-1]:
    print(f"\n🎉 ALL STATIONS COMPLETED!")
    print(f"✅ Built-in stations: {built_in}")
    if custom > 0:
        print(f"✅ Custom stations: {custom}")
    print("🎬 Production pipeline complete!")
```

## How It Works Now

### When You Resume

```bash
python resume_automation.py
```

**Example Output:**
```
📋 AVAILABLE SESSIONS:
──────────────────────────────────────
🎯 1. auto_20251012_232013
   📊 9 stations complete
   ▶️ Resume from: Station 10

📝 Choose session (1): 1

✅ Selected session: auto_20251012_232013
📊 Completed stations: 9
▶️ Starting from: Station 10

📦 CUSTOM STATIONS AVAILABLE:
   • Station 21: Add A Twist In The Story

🎯 Run Station 10 or specific station? [press Enter for 10]

🚀 RUNNING STATIONS FROM 10
============================================================
📊 Will run 12 station(s): [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21]

🚀 Running Station 10...
[... runs 10-20 ...]

🚀 Running Station 21...  ← YOUR CUSTOM STATION!
✅ Station 21 completed: Add A Twist In The Story

🎉 ALL STATIONS COMPLETED!
✅ Built-in stations: 21
✅ Custom stations: 1
🎬 Production pipeline complete!
```

## Benefits

### ✅ Seamless Integration
- Custom stations discovered automatically
- No manual configuration needed
- Works exactly like built-in stations

### ✅ Shows Custom Stations
- Lists custom stations when resuming
- Shows them as available options
- Includes them in the station count

### ✅ Runs Automatically
- After Station 20, continues to custom stations
- Runs in dependency order
- Includes in completion count

### ✅ Flexible Resume
- Can resume from any station (1-21+)
- Can skip to specific custom station
- Auto-detects remaining stations to run

## Testing

Verified working:

```bash
✅ Total stations: 22
✅ Custom stations (>20): 1
✅ Station 21: Add A Twist In The Story discovered
✅ Class loaded: Station21Output
✅ All discovery logic working
```

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Resume and Run Through Custom Stations

```bash
python resume_automation.py

# Select your session
# Choose starting station (e.g., 10)
# Runs 10 → 11 → ... → 20 → 21 ✅
```

### Example 2: Jump Directly to Custom Station

```bash
python resume_automation.py

# Select your session
# When asked for station, enter: 21
# Runs only Station 21
```

### Example 3: Run Only Custom Stations

```bash
python resume_automation.py

# Select your session
# Enter starting station: 21
# Runs 21 → 22 → ... (all custom stations)
```

## Compatibility

Both scripts now support custom stations:

| Script | Stations 1-20 | Custom Stations (21+) |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| `full_automation.py` | ✅ Hardcoded | ✅ Auto-discovered |
| `resume_automation.py` | ✅ Hardcoded | ✅ Auto-discovered |

## Status

🟢 **FULLY UPDATED**

✅ resume_automation.py supports custom stations
✅ Auto-discovery integrated
✅ Syntax validated
✅ Testing verified
✅ Documentation complete

**Both automation scripts now seamlessly support custom stations!** 🚀
