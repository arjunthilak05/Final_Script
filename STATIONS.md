  NARRATOR: [Transitions, internal reactions, time passages]
  [Continue scene showing narrator advantages]

she heard footsteps. Her hand moved to the gun in her pocket—the one she'd sworn she'd
never use.
[SFX: Footsteps on concrete, growing closer]
SARAH: (Whispered) Who's there?

  PARALLEL PROCESSING MODEL
  Instead of strict linear progression:**
  TRACK A (Creative Development)
  Station 1-3: Foundation → Station 4-10: Architecture
  ↓
  [Human Review Point]
  ↓
  Station 11-15: Episode Planning
  TRACK B (Quality Systems)
  Station 28-35: Create QA frameworks while Track A runs

(These can be set up in advance)
TRACK C (Script Production)
As soon as Episode 1 outline approved:
