# STATIONS 31-32: QUALITY ASSURANCE IMPLEMENTATION

**Implementation Date:** 2025-10-27
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE & READY FOR TESTING
**Deadline:** October 30, 2025 (3 days remaining)

---

## 📋 IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

### What Was Created

Two complete quality assurance stations with fully interactive user flows:

#### **Station 31: Dialogue Naturalness Pass**
- **File:** `station_31_dialogue_naturalness_pass.py` (15 KB)
- **Config:** `configs/station_31.yml` (9.0 KB)
- **Purpose:** Evaluate dialogue quality for voice acting
- **4 Analysis Checks:**
  1. Speakability Check (tongue twisters, breath points, rhythm)
  2. Naturalness Scoring (vocabulary, structure, fillers, interruptions)
  3. Identity Clarity Check (speaker identification, voice distinction)
  4. Subtext Verification (emotional layers, hidden meaning)

#### **Station 32: Audio-Only Clarity Audit**
- **File:** `station_32_audio_clarity_audit.py` (16 KB)
- **Config:** `configs/station_32.yml` (9.3 KB)
- **Purpose:** Validate scripts for audio-only listening
- **4 Audit Checks:**
  1. Scene Setting Clarity (location/time/presence in <10 seconds)
  2. Action Comprehension (physical/emotional actions tracked)
  3. Transition Clarity (time/location/POV transitions smooth)
  4. Information Delivery (natural exposition, audio-friendly language)

## 🔍 WHAT EACH STATION CHECKS

### Station 31 Detailed Analysis

#### Check 1: Speakability
- **Tongue Twisters:** Difficult consonant combinations
  - Example: "seventy-six percent" → recommend "76 percent"
  - Severity: Critical/Moderate/Minor
- **Breath Issues:** Sentences too long without breaks
  - Example: 37-word sentence with no natural pause point
  - Fix: Insert [BREATH] markers and break into phrases
- **Rhythm Issues:** Unnatural word order
  - Example: "Were you to pursue this..." → "If you pursue this..."

#### Check 2: Naturalness Scoring (0-5 scale)
- Vocabulary appropriateness (age, education, era, anachronisms)
- Sentence structure (varied lengths, complexity level)
- Filler words ("um", "like", "uh") for natural speech
- Interruptions/overlaps for realistic conversation

#### Check 3: Identity Clarity (0-10 scale)
- Speaker identification test (can listeners identify from voice alone?)
- Voice distinction (unique tics, patterns, phrases)
- Context clues (relationships, locations, time clear?)

#### Check 4: Subtext Verification (0-10 scale)
- Excellent subtext (8-10: layered, subtle)
- Adequate subtext (5-7: clear but could be deeper)
- Weak subtext (0-4: too obvious, tells instead of implies)

### Station 32 Detailed Analysis

#### Audit 1: Scene Setting Clarity (0-10)
- Location establishment within 10 seconds
- Time establishment (morning/night/days passing)
- Character presence clarity

#### Audit 2: Action Comprehension (0-10)
- Physical action tracking (drawer opens, footsteps, etc.)
- Character action clarity (who's moving, standing, sitting?)
- Emotional action tracking (anger build, voice changes)

#### Audit 3: Transition Clarity (0-10)
- Time transitions (how much time passes between scenes?)
- Location transitions (acoustic shift clear?)
- POV transitions (whose perspective are we following?)

#### Audit 4: Information Delivery (0-10)
- Natural integration (action-based information)
- Exposition dumps detection ("As you know..." phrases)
- Technical language issues (too complex for audio)
- Information overload (too many facts at once?)
