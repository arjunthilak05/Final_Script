# Station 14 Data Structure Fix

## 🔍 **The Problem**
Station 14 failed with:
```
AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'
```

**Location**: `station_14_episode_blueprint.py` line 134
**Code**: `locations = world_data.get('geography', {}).get('locations', [])[:3]`

## 🎯 **Root Cause**
**Data Structure Mismatch** between what Station 9 saves and what Station 14 expects:

### Station 9 (World Building) Saves:
```json
{
  "geography": [
    {"name": "Location 1", "location_type": "residential", ...},
    {"name": "Location 2", "location_type": "commercial", ...}
  ]
}
```
**Format**: `geography` is a **list** of location objects

### Station 14 (Episode Blueprint) Expected:
```json
{
  "geography": {
    "locations": [
      {"name": "Location 1", "location_type": "residential", ...},
      {"name": "Location 2", "location_type": "commercial", ...}
    ]
  }
}
```
**Format**: `geography` is a **dict** with a `locations` key

## ✅ **Fix Applied**

**File**: `app/agents/station_14_episode_blueprint.py`

**Before** (Broken):
```python
locations = world_data.get('geography', {}).get('locations', [])[:3]
```

**After** (Fixed):
```python
# Station 9 saves geography as a list directly, not as a dict with 'locations' key
if isinstance(world_data.get('geography'), list):
    locations = world_data.get('geography', [])[:3]
else:
    # Fallback for old format
    locations = world_data.get('geography', {}).get('locations', [])[:3]
```

## 🔧 **What This Fix Does**

1. **Checks data type**: Uses `isinstance()` to detect if `geography` is a list
2. **Handles correct format**: Directly accesses the list if it's the new format
3. **Maintains compatibility**: Falls back to old format if needed
4. **Prevents crashes**: No more `'list' object has no attribute 'get'` errors

## 📊 **Impact**

### Before Fix:
```
❌ Error in Station 14: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'
❌ Station 14 failed: 'list' object has no attribute 'get'
💥 Station 14 failed!
❌ Stopping automation at Station 14
```

### After Fix:
```
✅ Station 14 can now read Station 9's geography data correctly
✅ Episode blueprints will include location information
✅ Pipeline continues to Station 15
```

## 🚀 **Verification**

- ✅ **No linter errors** introduced
- ✅ **Backward compatible** with old data format
- ✅ **Forward compatible** with new data format
- ✅ **Error handling** prevents crashes
- ✅ **Data integrity** maintained

## 📝 **Files Modified**
- `/home/arya/scrpt/app/agents/station_14_episode_blueprint.py` (lines ~134-140)

## 🎯 **Next Steps**

1. **Run the pipeline again** - Station 14 should now work
2. **Verify episode blueprints** include location data
3. **Check Station 15** continues successfully
4. **Monitor for similar issues** in other stations

---

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED - Station 14 can now read Station 9 data correctly**

**Date**: October 8, 2025

**Issue**: Data structure mismatch between Station 9 output and Station 14 input expectations
