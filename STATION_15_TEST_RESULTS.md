## Generated Outline Statistics

### Episode 1 Breakdown

- **Total Scenes**: 12
- **Estimated Runtime**: ~31 minutes
- **Average Scene Length**: ~2.6 minutes
- **Unique Characters**: 2 (Tom, Colleagues)
- **Unique Locations**: 3 (Tom's Apartment, Tom's Office, Caf√©)

### Reveal Distribution

- **Plants**: 1 (Scene 1 - Mysterious message from Julia)
- **Proofs**: 2 (Scenes 4 & 9 - Julia knows Tom's past/grief)
- **Payoffs**: 1 (Scene 12 - Tom decides to meet Julia)
- **None**: 8 (Character development scenes)

### Scene Structure Example

**Scene 1: Tom's Apartment**
- Time: Morning
- Characters: Tom
- Runtime: 2 minutes
- Reveal: Plant (Tom receives mysterious message)
- Soundscape: Coffee machine, city hum, message ping, phone rustle
- Dramatic Structure: Goal-Obstacle-Choice-Consequence framework
- Transition: Natural flow to next scene

---

## Data Quality Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Consistent Structure**: All scenes follow the same Pydantic-validated format
2. **Audio-First Design**: Detailed soundscape notes for each scene
3. **Dramatic Progression**: Clear goal-obstacle-choice-consequence in each scene
4. **Reveal Integration**: Plant/Proof/Payoff structure properly applied
5. **Production Ready**: Runtime estimates, character lists, location tracking

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

- Context data (Character Bible, World Bible, Reveal Matrix) was not found in Redis
- This didn't prevent generation, but having full context would enhance quality
- The LLM still produced high-quality results based on the blueprint summary alone

## How to Run Tests

### Single Episode Test

```bash
# Test specific episode
python test_station_15_real_data.py auto_20251007_123810 1

# Test different episode
python test_station_15_real_data.py auto_20251007_123810 2
```

### Multiple Episodes Test

```bash
# Test first 3 episodes
python test_station_15_real_data.py auto_20251007_123810 --all 3

# Test all 6 episodes
python test_station_15_real_data.py auto_20251007_123810 --all 6
```

### Direct Agent Usage

```python
import asyncio
from app.agents.station_15_detailed_episode_outlining import (
    Station15DetailedEpisodeOutlining, Station15Input
)

async def run():
    input_data = Station15Input(
        session_id="auto_20251007_123810",
        episode_number=1,
        blueprint_summary="Your episode summary here..."
    )
    
    agent = Station15DetailedEpisodeOutlining(session_id=input_data.session_id)
    result = await agent.run(input_data)
    
    print(f"Generated {len(result.scenes)} scenes")

asyncio.run(run())
```
