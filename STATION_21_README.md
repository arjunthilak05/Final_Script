# üé¨ STATION 21: FIRST DRAFT (SCENE-BY-SCENE)

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE

Station 21 has been successfully implemented with full LLM-driven scene-by-scene script generation integrating all 20 previous stations.

2. **Multi-Episode Management** - Draft episodes in any order
3. **Complete Context Integration** - Uses all 20 previous stations
4. **Audio-First Storytelling** - Every element designed for audio production
5. **Multi-Format Output** - Fountain, JSON, TXT, PDF-ready
6. **Human Review Gates** - Quality control at critical points
7. **Loop Capability** - Draft multiple episodes in sequence

## üìä KEY TECHNICAL DETAILS

### **LLM Prompt Architecture:**
Station 21 builds a massive context-rich prompt that includes:

```
PROMPT SECTIONS (Dynamically Injected):
‚îú‚îÄ Project Context (title, genre, episode info)
‚îú‚îÄ Episode Blueprint (from Station 14)
‚îú‚îÄ Detailed Outline (from Station 15 - scene-by-scene)
‚îú‚îÄ Runtime Allocation (from Station 11 - word budgets)
‚îú‚îÄ Reveal Strategy (from Station 10 - P3 plants)
‚îú‚îÄ Hook Strategy (from Station 12)
‚îú‚îÄ Character Voices (from Station 6)
‚îú‚îÄ Audio Cue Library (from Station 9)
‚îú‚îÄ World Context (from Stations 7-9)
‚îú‚îÄ Validation Notes (from Stations 16-20)
‚îî‚îÄ Comprehensive Writing Guidelines
```

### **Prompt Engineering:**
- **~3000 tokens of context** (project-specific data)
- **~2000 tokens of instructions** (writing guidelines)
- **~16K token output** (script generation)
- **Total: ~21K tokens per episode draft**

### **Word Count Philosophy:**
- **First drafts target 67-75% of final word count**
- Example: 4,883 word target ‚Üí 3,287 word first draft (67%)
- Intentionally under-target to leave expansion room for:
  - Station 22: Polish Pass (add depth)
  - Station 23: Dialogue Polish (sharpen lines)
  - Station 24: Audio Cue Optimization
