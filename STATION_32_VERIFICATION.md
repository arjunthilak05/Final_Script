#### Line Numbers
- ✅ Every issue includes line_number
- ✅ Displayed as "(Line X)" in output

**Verification**: Config lines 50, 61, 72 (all locations)

#### Visual Indicators
- ✅ Color-coded score icons (🟢🟡🟠🔴)
- ✅ Severity indicators (🔴🟠🟡🟢)
- ✅ Critical issue badges

**Verification**: Code lines 610, 773-781

#### Readiness Checklist
```python
✓/✗ Overall clarity score >= threshold
✓/✗ Critical issues == 0
✓ PASS / ⚠️ WARNING for high priority (≤3 acceptable)
```

**Verification**: Code lines 671-700

---

### 4. Usability Improvements - ALL IMPLEMENTED ✅

#### Filtered Issues
- ✅ Top 5 issues shown (sorted by severity)
- ✅ CRITICAL issues first
- ✅ Only blocking issues highlighted

**Verification**: Code lines 606-607

#### Priority Sorting
```python
sorted_issues = sorted(issues, key=lambda x: self._severity_priority(x.get('severity', 'LOW')))
```

**Verification**: Code lines 763-771 (_severity_priority method)

#### Issue Counting
```python
def _count_issues_by_severity(self, data: Dict, severity: str) -> int:
    """Count issues by severity across all analyses"""
```

**Verification**: Code lines 773-803

#### Deduplication
- ✅ Config flag: `deduplicate_recommendations: true`
- ✅ Applied to recommendations

**Verification**: Config line 379

## 🎯 Enhanced Config Structure

### Output Enhancements Section
```yaml
output_enhancements:
  severity_levels:
    critical: "< 50 score OR blocks comprehension"
    high: "50-60 score OR major comprehension issue"
    medium: "60-70 score OR minor comprehension issue"
    low: "70-80 score OR enhancement opportunity"
  bullet_character: "•"
  encoding: "utf-8"
  include_line_numbers: true
  max_issues_per_category: 10
  deduplicate_recommendations: true
  include_readiness_checklist: true
  include_comparative_trends: true
  generate_patch_files: true
```

**Verification**: Config lines 366-383

## 📊 Enhanced Prompts Summary

All four prompts (scene_clarity, action_comprehension, transition_clarity, information_delivery) now include:

1. ✅ Assign severity (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
2. ✅ Mark blocking_comprehension boolean
3. ✅ Include line_number in all issues
4. ✅ Detect existing audio elements with confidence
5. ✅ Analyze empty signatures (missing vs detection)
6. ✅ Use 0-10 scale for sound effect integration
7. ✅ Provide audio-native alternatives
8. ✅ One-breath fixes for complex concepts
9. ✅ Mark disorientation_risk for transitions

**Verification**: Config lines 96-101, 172-177, 242-246, 314-318
