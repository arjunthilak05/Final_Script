# ‚úÖ System Verification Checklist

## üéØ Pre-Deployment Verification

Run this checklist before considering the system production-ready.

---

## 1. ‚úÖ Code Fixes Applied

- [x] **Station 11: `enable_debug_mode()` method added**
  - File: `app/agents/station_11_runtime_planning.py`
  - Lines: 114-124
  - Verified: Method exists and follows pattern

- [x] **Stations 5-7: Redis saving added to automation runner**
  - File: `full_automation.py`
  - Station 5: Line 550-551
  - Station 6: Line 632-633
  - Station 7: Line 728-729
  - Verified: All save with correct key format

---

## 2. üß™ Automated Tests

### Run Test Suite:
```bash
# Test Stations 8-14 PDF generation
python test_stations_8_14_pdf.py
```

**Expected Results:**
- ‚úÖ All 7 stations should pass
- ‚úÖ PDFs generated for each station
- ‚úÖ No critical errors
- ‚úÖ Test report JSON created

**Check:**
- [ ] All stations report "success"
- [ ] PDF files exist in `outputs/` directory
- [ ] PDF sizes are reasonable (>1KB each)
- [ ] Test report shows 7/7 passed

## 3. üîÑ Resume Functionality

### Test Resume Logic:

**Step 1: Start partial automation**
```bash
# Start automation and interrupt after Station 9
python full_automation.py --auto-approve --debug
# Press Ctrl+C after Station 9 completes
```

**Step 2: Verify checkpoint created**
```bash
ls -lh outputs/checkpoint_auto_*.json
```

```bash
python full_automation.py --list-checkpoints
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Checkpoint file exists
- [ ] Checkpoint shows current_station = 9
- [ ] List command displays checkpoint details

**Step 4: Resume from checkpoint**
```bash
python full_automation.py --resume auto_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] Loads checkpoint successfully
- [ ] Restores Redis data
- [ ] Continues from Station 10
- [ ] Completes through Station 14
- [ ] No errors during resume

---

## 4. üóÑÔ∏è Redis Data Verification

### Check Redis Keys After Full Run:

```bash
# If you have redis-cli installed:
redis-cli KEYS "audiobook:*:station_*"
```

**Expected Keys:**

audiobook:{session_id}:station_02
audiobook:{session_id}:station_03
audiobook:{session_id}:station_04
audiobook:{session_id}:station_04_5
audiobook:{session_id}:station_05
audiobook:{session_id}:station_06
audiobook:{session_id}:station_07
audiobook:{session_id}:station_08
audiobook:{session_id}:station_09
audiobook:{session_id}:station_10
audiobook:{session_id}:station_11
audiobook:{session_id}:station_12
audiobook:{session_id}:station_13
audiobook:{session_id}:station_14
```

**Check:**
- [ ] All 15 keys exist
- [ ] Keys follow correct naming pattern
- [ ] No typos in key names (e.g., `station_4_5` not `station_45`)

**After complete automation run, verify these exist:**

```bash
ls -lh outputs/
```

**Expected Files:**
- [ ] `automation_summary_{session_id}.json`

- [ ] `station8_character_bible_{session_id}.pdf`
- [ ] `station9_world_bible_{session_id}.pdf`
- [ ] `station10_narrative_reveal_{session_id}.pdf`
- [ ] `station11_runtime_planning_{session_id}.pdf` (if Station 11 generates PDF)
- [ ] `station12_hook_cliffhanger_{session_id}.pdf`
- [ ] `station13_multiworld_{session_id}.pdf`
- [ ] `station14_episode_blueprint_{session_id}.pdf`

## 6. üêõ Debug Mode Verification

### Test Debug Mode for All Stations:

```bash
python full_automation.py --auto-approve --debug
```

**Expected:**
- [ ] All stations that support debug mode log "Debug mode enabled"
- [ ] No `AttributeError` for missing `enable_debug_mode()`
- [ ] Detailed logging appears for:
  - Station 4
  - Station 4.5
  - Station 7
  - Station 8
  - Station 9
  - Station 11 (FIXED)

**Stations without debug mode (should not error):**
- Stations 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 12, 13, 14

**Test Scenario:**
```
Story Concept: "A cyberpunk detective in Neo-Tokyo discovers
a conspiracy involving rogue AI and must navigate both the
digital and physical worlds to uncover the truth."
```

**Run:**
```bash
python full_automation.py --auto-approve
# Enter the story concept when prompted
```

**Verification Points:**
- [ ] Station 1-4: Seed processing completes

```
**Expected:** Prompts for longer concept

**Test 2: Redis connection failure**
```python
# Stop Redis service temporarily
# Run automation
```
**Expected:** Graceful error message

**Test 3: File write permission error**
```bash
# Make outputs directory read-only
chmod 444 outputs/
python full_automation.py --auto-approve
```
**Expected:** Clear error message about permissions
