    ```json
    {{

        "working_titles": [
          "Audio-friendly title 1",
          "Audio-friendly title 2",
          "Audio-friendly title 3"

        "main_characters": [

          "Episode 4 ending cliffhanger (adjust count based on recommended option)"
        ]
      }}
    }}
    ```

    CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: The "episode_rationale" and "breaking_points" in initial_expansion MUST be based on your RECOMMENDED OPTION's episode count, not a different scale.
    - If you recommend Option A (MINI: 3-6 episodes), write rationale for 3-6 episodes
    - If you recommend Option B (STANDARD: 8-12 episodes), write rationale for 8-12 episodes
    - If you recommend Option C (EXTENDED: 20-40 episodes), write rationale for 20-40 episodes

    CRITICAL: Return ONLY valid JSON. No explanatory text, no markdown except the json code block.
