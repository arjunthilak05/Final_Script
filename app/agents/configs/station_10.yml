  task_1_reveal_taxonomy: |
    **TASK 1: REVEAL TAXONOMY CLASSIFICATION**

    **Project Context:**
    - Working Title: {working_title}
    - Primary Genre: {primary_genre}
    - Format: {episode_count} episodes, {episode_length} each
    - Story Complexity: {story_complexity}
    - Core Premise: {core_premise}

    **Complete Story Context from Previous Stations:**
    {complete_story_context}

    **Your Task:**
    Analyze ALL story information from previous stations and classify every piece of information into a reveal taxonomy based on WHEN and HOW the audience should learn it.

    **CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
    1. Identify EVERY significant story element (characters, relationships, secrets, mysteries, backstories, conflicts)
    2. Classify each element into one of four categories:
       - MUST KNOW BY EPISODE X (Critical plot points required for story comprehension)
       - SHOULD SUSPECT BY EPISODE Y (Clued revelations audience should piece together)
       - CAN DISCOVER IN EPISODE Z (Subtle clues for attentive listeners)
       - NEVER EXPLICITLY STATED (Ambiguous elements left to interpretation)
    3. For audio drama: Specify HOW each element is revealed through sound
    4. Map character knowledge vs audience knowledge positioning
    5. Identify which elements are audio-only (no dialogue needed)

    **Output Format:** Return ONLY valid JSON with this EXACT structure:

    - Format: {episode_count} episodes

    **Reveal Methods Selected:**
    {reveal_methods_summary}

    **Your Task:**
    Create a comprehensive PLANT/PROOF/PAYOFF grid for every major revelation. This is the production blueprint for information flow.

    **PLANT/PROOF/PAYOFF METHODOLOGY:**

    **PLANT** = Set up the information early
    - Appears innocuous on first listen
    - Becomes significant in retrospect
    - Multiple plants per revelation (redundancy)
    - Audio-specific plants (sounds, not just dialogue)

    **PROOF** = Evidence that connects plant to revelation
    - Callback to plant
    - New information that adds meaning
    - Can be visual, audio, or dialogue
    - "Aha!" moment for attentive audience

    **PAYOFF** = The revelation itself
    - Explicit confirmation
    - Recontextualizes all previous plants
    - Emotional/narrative impact
    - High relisten value

    **Project Context:**
    - Working Title: {working_title}
    - Primary Genre: {primary_genre}
    - Format: {episode_count} episodes

    **Story Elements:**
    {story_elements_summary}

    **Your Task:**
    Design believable false leads (red herrings) that misdirect the audience without being cheap or unfair. Good red herrings have logical foundations and satisfying debunks.

    **RED HERRING PRINCIPLES:**
    1. Must be BELIEVABLE - audience should reasonably suspect them
    2. Must have LOGICAL FOUNDATION - motive, means, opportunity
    3. Must be FAIR when debunked - clues were there all along
    4. Should ADD to story - not just waste time
    5. Debunk should be SATISFYING - "Oh, that makes sense!"

    **Types of Red Herrings:**
    - False Suspect: Character seems guilty but isn't
    - Misdirection Plot: Storyline that seems important but isn't
    - Object MacGuffin: Item seems important but isn't
    - False Revelation: Information seems true but gets contradicted
    - Timing Misdirection: Event seems connected but isn't

        "misdirection_plots": 0
      }}
    }}

    **Requirements:**
    - Design 3-7 major red herrings for full series
    - Each must have complete arc (intro â†’ suspicion â†’ debunk)
    - Stagger timing - don't debunk all at once
    - Ensure all are fair and logical
    - Audio execution must be specific
    - Return ONLY valid JSON

  task_5_fairness_check: |
    **TASK 5: FAIRNESS CHECK & SOLVABILITY ANALYSIS**

    **Project Context:**
    - Working Title: {working_title}
    - Primary Genre: {primary_genre}

    **Complete Reveal Strategy:**
    {complete_reveal_strategy}

    **Your Task:**
    Analyze the complete reveal strategy for fairness, solvability, and audience respect. This ensures the story rewards attention without requiring omniscience.

    **ANALYSIS DIMENSIONS:**

    1. **SOLVABILITY**: Could a smart, attentive audience theoretically figure this out before it's revealed?
    2. **RELISTEN VALUE**: Do earlier moments gain new meaning after revelations?
    3. **CLUE FINDABILITY**: Are clues hearable and fair, or hidden/cheap?
    4. **HIDDEN VS VISIBLE BALANCE**: Is information distribution appropriate?
    5. **FAIR PLAY PRINCIPLES**: Are mystery conventions respected?

    **FAIR PLAY PRINCIPLES (for Mystery/Thriller genres):**
    - All clues presented before reveals
    - No information withheld arbitrarily
    - Detective and audience have same tools
    - No deus ex machina solutions
    - Reveals feel earned, not arbitrary
