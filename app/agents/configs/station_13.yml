    TASK: Multi-World/Timeline Management Analysis

    This station is CONDITIONAL - only needed for projects with multiple worlds, timelines, or realities.
    
    First, analyze if this project requires multi-world/timeline management by checking for:
    - Multiple parallel universes/realities
    - Time travel elements
    - Flashbacks to different time periods
    - Parallel storylines in different locations/timeframes
    - Dreams/visions vs reality
    - Alternate timelines or "what if" scenarios
    - Fantasy/sci-fi elements with multiple dimensions

    If NO multi-world/timeline elements are detected, return a simple "not applicable" response.
    
    If YES, create comprehensive multi-world/timeline management:

    For each world/timeline:
    - World/timeline per episode
    - Transition sounds between worlds
    - Rules for each world
    - How differences are conveyed in audio

    Return your response as VALID JSON ONLY (no explanatory text before or after).

    Return this exact JSON structure:

      }}
    }}
    ```

    Remember:
    - Only proceed if multi-world/timeline elements are clearly present
    - Focus on audio-specific differentiation between worlds
    - Ensure clear transitions that listeners can follow
    - Maintain consistency within each world/timeline
    - If no multi-world elements exist, set "requires_management" to false
