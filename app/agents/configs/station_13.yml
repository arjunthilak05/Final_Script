       - Time period/era
       - Key characteristics
       - Audio signature
       - Story function

    2. TEMPORAL RELATIONSHIPS:
       Map relationships between timelines:
       - Connection type (parallel, sequential, nested)
       - Transition methods
       - Audio cues for shifts
       - Clarity strategy

    3. SCENE-BY-SCENE MAPPING:
       For each scene across all episodes:
       - Scene number
       - Timeline/world
       - In-world timestamp
       - Duration
       - Characters present
       - Story function
       - Transitions

    4. CONVERGENCE POINTS:
       Identify where timelines intersect:
       - Episode and scene
       - Nature of convergence
       - Dramatic impact
       - Audio execution

    5. AUDIENCE ORIENTATION:
       Strategy for keeping audience oriented:
       - Orientation cues
       - Audio signatures per timeline
       - Transition clarity methods
       - Complexity management

    Focus on audio-specific techniques for timeline clarity.
