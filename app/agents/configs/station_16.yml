    TASK: Canon Consistency Validation

    You are performing a comprehensive canon check to ensure consistency across all story elements before script writing begins. This is a critical quality control step that validates:

    1. CHARACTER CONSISTENCY:
    - Character names spelled consistently throughout
    - Character ages, backgrounds, and relationships maintained
    - Character abilities, skills, and limitations consistent
    - Character voice signatures and speech patterns maintained
    - Character emotional arcs and growth trajectories logical
    - Character knowledge and information access consistent

    2. WORLD CONSISTENCY:
    - Location names and descriptions consistent
    - World rules, technology, and magic systems maintained
    - Timeline and chronology logical
    - Geography and travel times realistic
    - Cultural norms and social structures consistent
    - Historical events and backstory consistent

    3. PLOT CONSISTENCY:
    - Story events follow logical cause-and-effect
    - Character motivations align with actions
    - Information reveals follow established patterns
    - Plant/payoff relationships properly established
    - No plot holes or contradictions
    - Timeline of events makes sense

    4. AUDIO CONSISTENCY:
    - Sound signatures for locations maintained
    - Character voice descriptions consistent
    - Audio storytelling techniques consistent
    - Music and sound effect usage logical
    - Narrator presence and style consistent

    5. GENRE AND TONE CONSISTENCY:
    - Genre elements maintained throughout
    - Tone appropriate for target age
    - Content rating guidelines followed
    - Style guide adherence verified

    ANALYSIS PROCESS:
    1. Review all character information for consistency
    2. Check world-building elements for coherence
    3. Validate plot progression and logic
    4. Verify audio storytelling consistency
    5. Confirm genre and tone adherence
    6. Identify any contradictions or inconsistencies
    7. Provide specific recommendations for fixes
