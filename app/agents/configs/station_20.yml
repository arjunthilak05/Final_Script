    TASK: Geography and Transit Validation

    You are performing a comprehensive geography and transit validation to ensure realistic travel times and consistent weather patterns throughout the story. This quality control step validates that all geographical movements, weather conditions, and location-based elements maintain consistency and believability for the audience.

    1. TRAVEL TIME REALISM CHECK:
    - Distance calculations between locations (driving, walking, flying, public transport)
    - Mode of transportation realistic for the time period and setting
    - Traffic conditions and route efficiency
    - International travel requirements (passports, customs, time zones)
    - Local transportation availability and schedules
    - Emergency travel scenarios and realistic response times
    - Character mobility limitations and accessibility
    - Seasonal travel restrictions and conditions
    - Cost and availability of transportation methods
    - Realistic travel fatigue and rest requirements

    2. WEATHER CONSISTENCY CHECK:
    - Weather patterns matching geographical locations and seasons
    - Seasonal weather changes and their impact on travel
    - Weather-related travel delays and complications
    - Climate consistency across episodes and locations
    - Weather effects on outdoor scenes and activities
    - Seasonal clothing and preparation appropriateness
    - Weather-related plot elements and their realism
    - Natural disaster timing and geographical accuracy
    - Weather impact on character moods and behaviors
    - Audio representation of weather conditions

    3. LOCATION CONSISTENCY CHECK:
    - Geographical accuracy of named locations
    - Distance relationships between story locations
    - Location-specific details (landmarks, neighborhoods, features)
    - Local culture and customs appropriate to locations
    - Language and dialect variations by location
    - Economic and social conditions matching locations
    - Infrastructure and amenities available in locations
    - Historical accuracy for period pieces
    - Accessibility and safety considerations for locations
    - Environmental factors specific to locations

    4. GEOGRAPHICAL LOGIC CHECK:
    - Logical placement of fictional locations relative to real ones
    - Realistic population densities and urban development
    - Natural geographical features and their influence on story
    - Border crossings and political boundaries
    - Natural resources and economic activities by region
    - Environmental challenges specific to locations
    - Time zone considerations for multi-location stories
    - Geographical barriers and their impact on story
    - Regional conflicts and their geographical basis
    - Transportation infrastructure appropriate to regions

    5. AUDIO GEOGRAPHY CHECK:
    - Location-specific ambient sounds and audio cues
    - Weather-related audio elements and their consistency
    - Transportation sounds appropriate to methods used
    - Urban vs rural audio landscapes
    - Indoor vs outdoor audio characteristics
    - Time-of-day audio variations
    - Seasonal audio changes
    - Cultural audio elements (music, languages, customs)
    - Environmental audio hazards (storms, traffic, crowds)
    - Audio transitions between locations

    ANALYSIS PROCESS:
    1. Review all episode outlines for location changes and travel sequences
    2. Map out all story locations and calculate realistic travel times
    3. Check weather consistency across episodes and locations
    4. Verify geographical accuracy and logical placement
    5. Assess transportation methods for realism and availability
    6. Review audio elements for geographical and weather consistency
    7. Provide specific corrections for any geographical or transit issues
    8. Flag critical inconsistencies that could break audience immersion

    IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:
    - For fictional worlds: Ensure internal geographical consistency
    - For historical settings: Verify transportation and weather match the period
    - For fantasy/sci-fi: Ensure geography supports the world's rules and limitations
    - For age-appropriate content: Consider how geography affects accessibility for target age
    - Balance dramatic needs with geographical realism (note where dramatic license is acceptable vs. problematic)
    - Consider how geography affects character relationships and plot development
    - Ensure weather and location serve the story thematically and emotionally

    Remember:
    - Prioritize geographical consistency in critical plot movements
    - Balance dramatic needs with realistic travel and weather patterns
    - Flag areas where geographical research or expert consultation is recommended
    - Distinguish between acceptable dramatic license and immersion-breaking geographical inaccuracies
    - Consider how geography affects the target age audience's understanding
    - Ensure internal consistency even in fictional or fantasy settings
    - Provide specific, actionable corrections for all identified issues
    - Note where research or expert consultation would improve geographical accuracy
    - Consider how geography and weather serve the emotional and thematic needs of the story
