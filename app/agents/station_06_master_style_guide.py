        The Master Style Guide for '{project_inputs.get('working_title', 'this audio drama')}' establishes a comprehensive creative framework for audio-only drama production targeting {project_inputs.get('target_age_range', '25-45')} audiences with {project_inputs.get('content_rating', 'PG-13')} content rating. 

        This {project_inputs.get('primary_genre', 'Psychological Thriller')} series employs {project_inputs.get('narrator_strategy', 'Limited Omniscient')} narration within a {project_inputs.get('chosen_screenplay_style', 'Classic Whodunit')} structure across {project_inputs.get('total_episodes', 10)} episodes. The style guide integrates sophisticated language rules appropriate for adult audiences, distinct character voice signatures for audio-only identification, comprehensive audio conventions for temporal and spatial navigation, natural dialogue principles optimized for audio comprehension, and a unique sonic signature that supports both mystery elements and psychological depth.

        All elements work together to create an immersive audio experience that respects audience intelligence while ensuring accessibility and emotional engagement throughout the {project_inputs.get('episode_count', '10')} × {project_inputs.get('episode_length', '45 minutes')} season structure.
