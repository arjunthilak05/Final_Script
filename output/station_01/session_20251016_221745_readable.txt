When Tom’s actual client complains about never receiving messages, he realizes his mistake. He tracks down the wrong number to apologize, finding Julia on the worst day of her life. Their meeting reveals that Julia has been anonymously funding Tom’s coaching business to help others like these messages helped her.

Core Premise:
A morning motivation coach accidentally texts daily inspirational messages to a depressed ER doctor instead of his client. These messages become her lifeline, leading to an unexpected connection and revelation when they finally meet.
