For one year, morning motivation coach Tom has been texting daily inspirational messages to what he thinks is his client’s number.

When Tom’s actual client complains about never receiving messages, he realizes his mistake. He tracks down the wrong number to apologize, finding Julia on the worst day of her life. Their meeting reveals that Julia has been anonymously funding Tom’s coaching business to help others like these messages helped her.
