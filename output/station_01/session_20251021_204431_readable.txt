When the mistake is discovered, their face-to-face meeting reveals Julia has been anonymously funding Tom's business to help others as she was helped.

Central Conflict:

Tom must reconcile his professional ethics with the reality that his greatest impact came from a mistake, while both characters navigate their growing feelings for each other.
