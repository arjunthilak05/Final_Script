  "working_title": "The Accidental Lifeline",
  "original_seed": "For one year, morning motivation coach Tom has been unknowingly texting daily inspirational messages to the wrong number. His words reach Julia, a depressed ER doctor struggling to stay afloat amid the chaos of her life. Each message becomes her silent lifeline—brief moments of calm cutting through the noise of the hospital and her own despair. Tom’s voice echoes in her mind, guiding her through dark days, while she never corrects the mistake, afraid to lose the only thing keeping her grounded. When Tom’s actual client complains about never receiving messages, he discovers the error and tracks down the unknown recipient to apologize. On the worst day of Julia’s life, their paths finally cross, and Tom realizes the profound impact his words have had. In a touching twist, he learns that Julia has been anonymously funding his coaching business all along—hoping to help others find the same strength his accidental messages once gave her.",
