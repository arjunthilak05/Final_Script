        "production_notes": "Create a rich ambient soundscape of holiday lights and distant crowds. The phone notification should sound similar to the one in Episode 1, creating a callback. Record Tom's final message with warmth and intimacy, using close-mic technique. Consider adding subtle musical motifs from earlier episodes as the scene concludes, bringing the series to a cohesive emotional close."
