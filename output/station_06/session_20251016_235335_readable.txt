DIALECT/ACCENT MAP
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Character Voice Distinctions: Tom should have a warm, motivational speaking style with clear articulation. Julia's voice should carry the weight of her professional role as an ER doctor but soften during personal moments. Sarah should have a distinct, professional client voice. Dr. Martinez should have a confident, authoritative medical professional tone.
Regional Markers: Set in a contemporary urban environment with neutral, standard accents reflecting professional diversity in a bustling city hospital setting. Avoid strong regional accents that might distract from the emotional content.
