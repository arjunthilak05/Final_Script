      "language_rules": {
        "vocabulary_level": "Sophisticated adult vocabulary with occasional industry-specific jargon relevant to professional settings, but avoiding overly academic or obscure terms",
        "sentence_complexity": "Balanced complexity with varied sentence structures. Longer sentences for reflective moments, shorter sentences for emotional impact. Complex emotional and professional concepts are explained through character experiences rather than abstract exposition.",
        "technical_term_handling": "Medical terminology should be commonly understood terms with context provided through character interactions. Coaching/wellness industry terms should be accessible to general adult audience. Technical terms are always explained through character dialogue or situation rather than narrator exposition.",
        "narrator_voice_guidelines": "The narrator's voice should evolve with the tonal shift, starting with more distant delivery in early episodes and becoming warmer and more intimate as the story progresses. Begin with an omniscient third-person narrator who establishes the tone and characters. Use consistent audio markers for narrator appearances - a subtle musical phrase or specific reverb treatment that signals narrator presence.",
        "age_appropriate_language": "PG-13 content rating with mature themes including depression, professional burnout, and romantic relationships requiring emotional depth but avoiding explicit content. Forbidden topics include explicit sexual content, graphic violence, self-harm depiction, and discriminatory language.",
        "genre_specific_terminology": "Contemporary Romance terminology focusing on emotional connection, vulnerability, and relationship development. Drama terminology emphasizing emotional stakes and character growth. Medical drama terminology accessible to general adult audience.",

      "dialect_accent_map": {
        "character_voice_distinctions": "Tom: Warm, measured, professional coaching voice with moments of vulnerability. Julia: Initially more restrained, clinical tone that gradually warms as she opens up. Sarah (Tom's client): Distinctly different energy from Julia - more direct, business-oriented. Dr. Martinez: Professional medical tone with colleague familiarity.",
        "regional_markers": "Mid-sized American city setting with neutral American accents. Subtle regional markers may indicate character backgrounds but should not distract from the emotional content. Healthcare professionals may have slightly more precise articulation reflecting their training.",
        "pronunciation_guide": {
          "character_names": {
            "Tom": "tɒm",

          }
        },
        "voice_casting_notes": "Cast voices that can effectively convey emotional range from depression to hope. Julia's voice actress must particularly convey subtle shifts from clinical detachment to emotional openness. Tom's voice actor should balance professional coaching warmth with personal vulnerability.",
        "accent_consistency_rules": "Maintain consistent accent patterns for each character throughout the series. Any regional markers should be established early and maintained consistently. Medical professionals should maintain consistent professional articulation even during emotional moments."
      },
      "audio_conventions": {
        "scene_transitions": "Use hybrid approach with narrator-guided transitions in early episodes becoming more character-driven as series progresses. Implement subtle musical phrases or specific reverb treatments to signal transitions. In darker episodes (3:1 ratio), transitions use more reverb and minor key elements. In lighter episodes (1:3 ratio), transitions use brighter musical elements and closer microphone techniques.",
        "flashback_conventions": "Flashbacks indicated by distinctive audio treatment - subtle reverb, slight pitch shift, or layered voice effect. Narrator introduces flashbacks in early episodes, while later episodes may use character-triggered flashbacks with more subtle audio cues. Maintain the dark/light balance appropriate to the episode's position in the series.",
        "location_establishment": "Each key location has a distinctive acoustic signature: Julia's apartment (quiet with distant city sounds, clock ticking, occasional phone notifications), ER hospital (constant beeping of medical equipment, hurried footsteps, overlapping conversations, paging announcements), Tom's home office (quiet typing, gentle background music, coffee mug sounds, comfortable chair sounds). These signatures are established early and used consistently throughout the series.",
        "silence_usage": "Strategic use of negative space in audio mix to create emotional impact. Moments of overwhelm are followed by carefully placed silence that allows emotional weight to land. Moments of connection sometimes feature comfortable silence conveyed through ambient room tone without dialogue. Silence duration varies with emotional context but never exceeds 5-7 seconds in early episodes, potentially extending slightly in later episodes as emotional complexity grows.",
        "sound_cue_system": "Text messages receive distinctive audio treatment - subtle notification sound followed by voiceover with slightly different audio processing than regular dialogue. Audio 'glimmers' of hope in dark episodes use subtle musical or sound design elements. Character emotional states reflected through environmental sounds (e.g., rain during sadness, birdsong during hopeful moments).",
        "time_markers": "Time indicated through character dialogue, sound design (clock ticking in Julia's apartment), and narrator exposition in early episodes. As series progresses, rely more on sound design and character cues to indicate time passage. Hospital scenes use paging announcements and shift changes to mark time progression."
      },
      "dialogue_principles": {
        "natural_vs_theatrical": "Balance leaning toward natural delivery with heightened emotional moments allowing for more theatrical expression. Medical professionals maintain more measured delivery even in emotional moments. Dialogue should reflect authentic adult relationships with appropriate emotional depth for the 28-50 age demographic.",
        "interruption_rules": "Interruptions reflect emotional states - more frequent in high-stress hospital scenes, less frequent in intimate moments. ER scenes may feature overlapping conversations to create authentic chaos. Intimate moments between Tom and Julia feature fewer interruptions, creating space for emotional connection.",
        "character_identification": "Characters identified through distinctive voice qualities, consistent acoustic treatment, and occasional name drops in dialogue. In scenes with multiple medical professionals, subtle audio cues (different microphone placement, room tone) help distinguish characters. Narrator provides identification assistance in early episodes, gradually reducing this role as series progresses.",
        "emotional_delivery": "Voice performances modulate between flatter affect during depressive episodes and more dynamic range during hopeful moments. Julia's emotional delivery shows the greatest evolution throughout the series. Use proximity effect in microphone placement - characters experiencing depression or isolation are recorded with slightly more distance, while moments of connection use closer microphone techniques.",
        "pacing_control": "Dialogue pacing reflects emotional states - slower during depressive episodes, quicker during hopeful moments. ER scenes feature quicker pacing and overlapping dialogue to create authentic chaos. Intimate moments between Tom and Julia feature deliberate pacing that allows emotional resonance. Pacing gradually shifts from slower to quicker as series progresses from dark to light.",
        "subtext_handling": "Subtext conveyed through vocal performance nuances, pacing, and strategic pauses. Narrator provides insight into subtext in early episodes, gradually reducing this role as series progresses. Sound design supports subtext through environmental cues that reflect characters' emotional states. Julia's character particularly requires nuanced subtext delivery as she evolves from emotional guardedness to openness."
      },
      "narration_style": {
        "narrator_presence": "The narrator appears most heavily in early episodes (40-50% presence) during the 3:1 dark to light ratio phase. In mid-series episodes (1:1 ratio), narrator presence reduces to 20-30%. In concluding episodes (1:3 ratio), narrator presence is minimal (10-15% or less), appearing only for thematic commentary or critical transitions.",
        "narrator_relationship": "This guide implements the 'Hybrid Approach' strategy selected in Station 4.5. The narrator begins as an omniscient third-person presence who establishes the tone and characters, then gradually recedes as the story progresses, shifting more weight to character voices and sound design. The narrator's relationship to the story evolves from guiding presence to occasional commentator, allowing for more intimate character moments as the series progresses from dark to light.",
        "tense_and_person": "Third-person omniscient perspective with present tense for immediacy. narrator may shift to past tense for reflective moments, particularly in early episodes. Person remains consistently third-person throughout the series.",
        "narrator_personality": "The narrator's voice evolves with the tonal shift, starting with more distant delivery in early episodes and becoming warmer and more intimate as the story progresses. In early episodes, narrator maintains professional, slightly detached tone appropriate for the darker content. In later episodes, narrator adopts warmer, more intimate tone reflecting the lighter content. The narrator never becomes a character in the story but maintains consistent personality throughout.",
        "narrator_functions": "Narrator appears during: 1) Complex emotional transitions that benefit from guided perspective, 2) Scenes requiring significant internal thought exposition, 3) Critical plot points needing clarification, 4) Moments when audio 'glimmers' of hope need emphasis in dark episodes, 5) Time jumps or scene transitions that might otherwise confuse listeners. Narrator recedes during intimate character interactions, lighter moments, dialogue-heavy scenes, and the conclusion.",
        "narrator_voice_casting": "Narrator voice actor must have exceptional range to evolve from distant to intimate delivery throughout the series. Voice should be warm but professional, with ability to convey both emotional weight and hope. Voice actor must be able to maintain consistent character while evolving tone across the series."
      },
      "sonic_signature": {
        "recurring_motifs": "Water motifs (rain, streams, oceans) representing emotional states from stormy to calm. Text message notification sound that evolves throughout the series - initially more jarring, becoming more comforting. Clock ticking motif representing time passage and Julia's structured life that gradually softens as she opens up.",
        "character_themes": "Julia: Minor key piano theme that gradually incorporates warmer tones as healing progresses. Tom: Gentle guitar theme with steady rhythm reflecting his coaching background. Sarah: More direct, business-like musical motif with electronic elements. Dr. Martinez: Professional medical theme with precise instrumentation that occasionally reveals warmer personal notes.",
        "environmental_soundscapes": "Julia's apartment: quiet with distant city sounds, clock ticking, occasional phone notifications. ER hospital: constant beeping of medical equipment, hurried footsteps, overlapping conversations, paging announcements. Tom's home office: quiet typing, gentle background music, coffee mug sounds, comfortable chair sounds. These soundscapes evolve throughout the series - hospital sounds become less overwhelming as Julia's burnout improves, Tom's office sounds become more vibrant as his business grows.",
        "genre_audio_elements": "Romance elements: warmer musical themes, closer microphone techniques for intimate moments, subtle sound design that supports emotional connection. Drama elements: heightened tension through dissonant musical elements, strategic silence, voice performances with greater emotional range. Contemporary elements: digital notification sounds, keyboard typing, modern medical equipment sounds.",
        "mood_sound_palette": "Dark moods: reverb that creates emotional distance, minor key musical themes, voice performances with restrained affect, sparse environmental sounds. Light moods: closer microphone techniques, major key musical elements, more expressive voice performances, clearer environmental sounds. Transitional moods: blend of dark and light elements with gradual shifts in audio treatment.",
        "audio_identity": "The series maintains a delicate balance between emotional darkness and uplifting hope, exploring how human connection can emerge from unexpected circumstances. The audio identity carries the weight of depression and professional burnout while consistently offering moments of warmth and possibility. The sonic palette evolves from darker to lighter across the series while maintaining authentic representation of mental health challenges.",
        "musical_references": "Max Richter's minimalist piano compositions for emotional depth and hope. Ólafur Arnalds' ambient textures that blend melancholy with warmth. Hildur Guðnadóttir's cello work that conveys emotional weight and transformation."
