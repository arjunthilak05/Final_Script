        "character_voice_distinctions": "Tom should have a clear, warm, and confident voice that reflects his coaching persona; Julia should have a voice that transitions from weary to increasingly hopeful, with a professional medical cadence; Sarah should have a more energetic, business-like tone; Dr. Martinez should have a professional medical voice with slight cultural inflections reflecting diversity",
        "regional_markers": "Subtle urban Northeastern markers (Chicago/Philadelphia) for all characters, avoiding heavy regional accents that might distract from the narrative. Professional settings (hospital, coaching studio) should feature more neutral speech patterns.",

        "voice_casting_notes": "Cast actors who can convey emotional range through vocal subtlety rather than dramatic shifts. Medical professionals should sound authentic but not overly technical. Coaching voice should be warm and encouraging without sounding saccharine.",
        "accent_consistency_rules": "Maintain consistent vocal characteristics for each character throughout the series. Any accent variations should be intentional and story-driven (e.g., Julia's voice may become less tense as her character develops)."
      },
      "audio_conventions": {
        "scene_transitions": "Use narrator-led transitions between scenes with elegant segues, maintaining narrative flow. For major location changes, use distinctive acoustic signatures (hospital beeps, studio music, apartment silence) as transitional elements.",
        "flashback_conventions": "Flashbacks should be introduced with a subtle audio filter (slight reverb or echo) and possibly a brief musical motif. The narrator should explicitly establish the time shift with phrases like 'Julia remembered...' or 'Tom thought back to...'",
        "location_establishment": "Each key location should be immediately established through its acoustic signature: Hospital ER (constant beeping of monitors, footsteps, intercom pages); Tom's coaching studio (subtle background music, clear voice recording, keyboard taps, notification chimes); Julia's apartment (refrigerator hum, distant traffic, phone tapping, occasional sighs or glass clinking).",
        "silence_usage": "Strategic silence should be used during emotional moments, particularly when characters are processing information or experiencing revelation. Silence should never exceed 3-4 seconds in duration to maintain engagement.",
        "sound_cue_system": "Develop a consistent system for recurring sound cues: text message notifications (distinctive chime), hospital emergencies (escalating beeps and urgent voices), emotional breakthroughs (subtle piano motifs), and tension building (heartbeat sound effects).",
        "time_markers": "Time should be indicated through narrator exposition ('Later that evening...'), ambient sound changes (daytime traffic vs. nighttime quiet), and occasionally through character dialogue mentioning time-specific activities."
      },
      "dialogue_principles": {
        "natural_vs_theatrical": "Dialogue should lean toward naturalistic delivery with moments of theatrical emphasis during emotional climaxes. Medical and coaching dialogue should maintain professional authenticity while remaining accessible to listeners.",
        "interruption_rules": "Interruptions should be used sparingly and only for dramatic effect. When used, they should be clearly audible with overlapping voices that remain comprehensible. In high-stress hospital scenes, more frequent interruptions may be used to create urgency.",
        "character_identification": "Characters should be identified through name usage in dialogue, distinctive vocal characteristics, and sometimes narrator clarification. In group scenes, characters should address each other by name early in the conversation.",
        "emotional_delivery": "Emotional expression should be conveyed through vocal modulation rather than explicit statements. Subtle changes in pitch, pace, and volume should reflect internal states, with the narrator providing context when necessary.",
        "pacing_control": "Dialogue pacing should vary by location and emotional state: hospital scenes should have faster, more urgent pacing; intimate moments should have slower, more deliberate pacing; coaching messages should have measured, thoughtful pacing.",
        "subtext_handling": "Subtext should be conveyed through pauses, vocal hesitations, and carefully chosen words that imply more than they state. The narrator may occasionally clarify subtext through internal thought revelations."

      "narration_style": {
        "narrator_presence": "Moderate presence, appearing regularly but not dominating scenes (20-30% of runtime)",
        "narrator_relationship": "This guide implements the 'A: Omniscient third-person' strategy selected in Station 4.5. The narrator knows all characters' thoughts and feelings but maintains a balanced, objective tone that enhances rather than overwhelms the drama. The narrator serves as a trusted guide through the narrative, providing context and emotional depth that might otherwise be lost in audio format.",
        "tense_and_person": "Third-person omniscient narration, primarily using past tense with occasional present tense for immediacy during emotional moments.",
        "narrator_personality": "Warm, empathetic, with clear diction and the ability to convey subtle emotional shifts. The narrator sounds mature but not elderly, with a voice that suggests wisdom and understanding without being judgmental.",

        "narrator_voice_casting": "Gender-neutral casting with age range 40-60. Voice quality should be warm, empathetic, with clear diction and the ability to convey subtle emotional shifts. Should sound mature but not elderly, with a voice that suggests wisdom and understanding without being judgmental."

      "sonic_signature": {
        "recurring_motifs": "A soft piano melody that represents the 'accidental connection' between Tom and Julia; a heartbeat rhythm that intensifies during moments of emotional revelation; a text notification chime that becomes increasingly significant as the story progresses.",
        "character_themes": "Tom's theme: Clear, resonant tones with uplifting musical undertones; Julia's theme: More complex, layered sounds that transition from dissonant to harmonious; Sarah's theme: Business-like, structured rhythms; Dr. Martinez's theme: Professional, steady tones with subtle cultural musical elements.",
        "environmental_soundscapes": "Hospital ER: Constant beeping of medical monitors, hurried footsteps, urgent pages, hushed consultations, ambulance sirens; Tom's coaching studio: Subtle background music, clear voice recording, keyboard taps, coffee sips, notification chimes; Julia's apartment: Refrigerator hum, distant traffic, phone tapping, sighs, wine glass clinking.",
        "genre_audio_elements": "Drama elements: Tense musical underscoring during conflicts, silence during emotional moments, voice clarity during important revelations; Romance elements: Subtle piano motifs during intimate moments, close-mic techniques for personal dialogue, gentle ambient sounds during connecting scenes.",
        "mood_sound_palette": "Hope: Bright piano chords with light percussion; Despair: Minor key melodies with sparse instrumentation; Tension: Dissonant chords with heartbeat rhythms; Intimacy: Soft piano with warm strings; Resolution: Harmonious melodies with full instrumentation.",
        "audio_identity": "The overall audio identity balances clinical precision (hospital), motivational clarity (coaching studio), and intimate vulnerability (apartment). Sound design should emphasize the contrast between these spaces while creating sonic cohesion through recurring motifs and careful attention to emotional resonance.",
        "musical_references": "Max Richter's minimalist piano compositions for emotional depth and introspection; Olafur Arnalds' ambient textures for creating atmospheric tension and release; Nils Frahm's blend of classical and electronic elements for bridging the clinical and emotional aspects of the story."
