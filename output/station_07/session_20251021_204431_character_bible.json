    "tone": "The narrative maintains a 3:1 ratio of dark to light moments in early episodes, gradually shifting to 1:1 by mid-series and finally to 1:3 in the conclusion. Dark moments are conveyed through audio techniques like reverb that create emotional distance, minor key musical themes, and voice performances with restrained affect. Light moments use closer microphone techniques, major key musical elements, and more expressive voice performances. Crucially, even the darkest episodes contain brief audio 'glimmers' - subtle musical or sound design elements suggesting hope. Similarly, the lightest moments retain subtle audio textures that acknowledge the ongoing reality of mental health challenges, creating an authentic balance that never sugarcoats the journey while consistently offering auditory signposts of hope.",
