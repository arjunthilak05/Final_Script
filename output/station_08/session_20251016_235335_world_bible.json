Early episodes focus on establishing the characters and their relationships, with a mix of light, hopeful moments and hints of underlying tension. As the series progresses, the dark moments become more prominent, with intense conflicts and emotional challenges. However, these are always balanced with moments of light and hope, such as small victories and tender moments, to maintain the overall emotional resonance and prevent the tone from becoming overwhelmingly bleak.",
