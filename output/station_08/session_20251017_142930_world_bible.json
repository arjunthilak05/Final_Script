    "tone": "The audio narrative carefully balances dark moments of depression and conflict with light moments of connection and humor through a nuanced approach. Dark moments are characterized by minimal sound design, lower vocal registers, and dissonant musical elements, but are never allowed to dominate for extended periods. Light moments feature warmer musical tones, more dynamic vocal performances, and richer environmental sounds. The balance shifts progressively across episodes, with early installments weighted toward darkness (60/40 dark/light), middle episodes achieving equilibrium (50/50), and final episodes leaning toward light (40/60 dark/light). This progression reflects the characters' emotional journeys while maintaining authentic dramatic tension throughout.",
