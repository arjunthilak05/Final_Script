ANALYSIS RESULT: NOT APPLICABLE
============================================================

This project does not require multi-world/timeline management.

REASONING:
No multi-world/timeline elements are present in the project data. The project context shows all key elements as 'Unknown' or 'No data available', with no indication of parallel universes, time travel, alternate timelines, or other multi-world elements that would require specialized management.

Station 13 is conditionally skipped for this project.
Proceed to Station 14: Simple Episode Blueprint.
