Project: The Accidental Lifeline

============================================================
ANALYSIS RESULT: NOT APPLICABLE
============================================================

This project does not require multi-world/timeline management.

REASONING:
The project 'The Accidental Lifeline' is a straightforward drama set in a single reality with a linear timeline. The narrative follows traditional character development and plot progression without elements of parallel universes, time travel, alternate dimensions, or other multi-world/timeline features that would require special management.

Station 13 is conditionally skipped for this project.
Proceed to Station 14: Simple Episode Blueprint.
