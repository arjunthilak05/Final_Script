Project: The Accidental Lifeline

============================================================
ANALYSIS RESULT: NOT APPLICABLE
============================================================

This project does not require multi-world/timeline management.

REASONING:
The project 'The Accidental Lifeline' is a straightforward drama set in a single reality/timeline. The story focuses on the relationship between Tom (a life coach) and Julia (an ER nurse) that develops through Tom accidentally sending motivational messages to her. There are no elements of multiple parallel universes, time travel, alternate timelines, or other dimensional realities in the provided project documentation. The narrative structure follows a conventional dramatic arc without any complex multi-world or timeline mechanics that would require specialized management.

Station 13 is conditionally skipped for this project.
