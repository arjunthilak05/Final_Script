Music should progress from neutral to tense to hopeful across the series, reflecting the emotional arc. Special attention should be paid to the audio representation of text messages and their impact on Julia. Voice actors should clearly differentiate the characters' emotional states through vocal performance, with particular attention to Julia's journey from despair to hope and Tom's development from naive confidence to deeper understanding."
