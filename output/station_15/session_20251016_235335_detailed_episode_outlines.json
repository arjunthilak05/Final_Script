    "series_structure_notes": "This first episode establishes the core premise of the series - an ordinary person developing an extraordinary ability to hear thoughts. The episode follows Alex's journey from disbelief to acceptance of this ability, culminating in a moral choice to use it to prevent harm. This sets up the central conflict of the series: how to responsibly use an invasive ability that connects Alex to others in unexpected ways. Future episodes will explore the origin of this ability, introduce others with similar gifts, and develop the consequences of Alex's intervention in this episode.",
    "production_considerations": "The series requires sophisticated sound design to distinguish between normal sounds, thoughts, and the mysterious phenomenon. Voice actors will need to perform 'thought' dialogue differently from spoken dialogue - perhaps with more intimacy, different pacing, or specific vocal qualities. The production should establish distinct acoustic signatures for key locations (Alex's apartment, city streets, etc.). Music should be used sparingly but effectively to underscore emotional moments without overwhelming the intricate sound design."
