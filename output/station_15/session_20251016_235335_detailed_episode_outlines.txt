AUDIO PRODUCTION NOTES: Use audio to create tension during the near-miss scenes, with close calls in sound design. The coffee shop scene should have a relaxed atmosphere that becomes tense with hesitation. Sarah's scene should use audio to show her growth through confident voice patterns. Tom's final decision scene should build to a moment of determination through audio cues. Continue using distinct audio signatures for each character's environment.

SERIES STRUCTURE NOTES
============================================================
The five-episode series follows a clear narrative arc from accidental connection to intentional relationship. Each episode builds on the previous one, with escalating emotional stakes and character development. The audio design consistently uses distinct sound signatures for each character and location, creating a rich auditory world that enhances the storytelling. The series explores themes of mental health, the unexpected impact we can have on others, and how meaningful connections can form in unlikely ways. Each episode ends with a hook that leads naturally into the next, building tension and anticipation. The final episode provides a satisfying resolution while leaving room for future development of the characters' relationships.

============================================================
PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
============================================================
The series requires careful attention to audio design to create distinct environments for each character and to convey emotional states through sound. The message notification sound should remain consistent throughout the series. Voice actors need to convey subtle emotional shifts, particularly for Julia's journey from depression to hope. The hospital scenes require layered sound design to create urgency and chaos, while more intimate scenes need focused, clean audio to emphasize emotional moments. Music should be used sparingly to enhance emotional beats without overwhelming the storytelling. The series should maintain a balance between dialogue and sound design to fully utilize the audio-only medium.
