============================================================
SERIES STRUCTURE NOTES
============================================================
The detailed episode outlines follow a clear narrative arc that progresses from accidental connection to intentional relationship. Each episode builds on the previous one, with increasing emotional stakes and character development. The series structure follows a 'Rise→Fall→Redemption Arc' with Tom and Julia's relationship evolving through five distinct phases: 1) Accidental connection, 2) Growing dependence, 3) Discovery and crisis, 4) Near-misses and anticipation, and 5) Intentional connection. The audio storytelling reinforces this arc through carefully designed soundscapes that reflect the characters' emotional states and the progression of their relationship.

============================================================
PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
============================================================
The production should focus on creating distinct audio environments for Tom's world (calm, organized, professional) and Julia's world (chaotic, stressful, medical). The contrast between these environments should be emphasized through sound design. The narration should guide the audience through the emotional journey, with tone shifts that match the characters' development. Music should progress from neutral to tense to hopeful across the series, reflecting the emotional arc. Special attention should be paid to the audio representation of text messages and their impact on Julia. Voice actors should clearly differentiate the characters' emotional states through vocal performance, with particular attention to Julia's journey from despair to hope and Tom's development from naive confidence to deeper understanding.
