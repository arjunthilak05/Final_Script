SERIES STRUCTURE NOTES
============================================================
The first six episodes establish the core premise of 'The Accidental Lifeline' - how Tom's accidental messages to Julia became a lifeline for her during her depression. The series follows their individual journeys, the growing mystery of their connection, and their eventual meeting. Each episode builds on the last, revealing more about the characters and their worlds while maintaining the central mystery. The audio storytelling emphasizes the contrast between their different environments and the emotional impact of their connection. The cliffhangers create anticipation for the next episode while advancing the overall narrative.

============================================================
PRODUCTION CONSIDERATIONS
============================================================
The audio production should focus on creating distinct soundscapes for each character's environment - Tom's apartment and office versus Julia's hospital and home. The message notification sounds should be used as recurring audio motifs throughout the series. The emotional states of the characters should be conveyed through voice acting, sound effects, and subtle musical cues. The cliffhangers should be enhanced with sudden audio shifts or silences to maximize impact. The series should maintain a balanced audio mix that allows for both clear dialogue and rich environmental storytelling.
