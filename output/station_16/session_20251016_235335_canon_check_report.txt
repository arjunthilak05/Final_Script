VALIDATION NOTES

This project cannot proceed to script writing without foundational elements. All critical issues must be addressed before a meaningful canon consistency validation can be performed. The project team needs to develop character bibles, world building documentation, episode outlines, and define the audio-specific requirements before continuing.
