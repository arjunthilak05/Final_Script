============================================================
AGE APPROPRIATENESS ANALYSIS
============================================================
Status: FAIL
Target Age: Unknown

Issues Found:
  - vocabulary_too_complex: Target age range not defined, making age-appropriate language assessment impossible
    Severity: critical
    Location: Project Context
    Recommendation: Define target age range to establish appropriate vocabulary, sentence complexity, and content guidelines

Language Guidelines: Cannot establish language guidelines without knowing target age range

============================================================
DIALECT CONSISTENCY ANALYSIS
============================================================
Status: PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Issues Found:
  - regional_dialect_inconsistency: No world building information available to determine cultural or regional dialect requirements
    Severity: warning
    Location: World Building
    Recommendation: Develop World Building documentation to establish cultural and regional speech patterns

Dialect Guidelines: Dialect guidelines cannot be established without world building information

============================================================
AUDIO CLARITY ANALYSIS
============================================================
Status: PASS_WITH_WARNINGS

Issues Found:
  - speaker_identification_difficult: Without character voices defined, speaker identification planning cannot be completed
    Severity: warning
    Location: Character Bible
    Recommendation: Define distinct voice characteristics for each character to ensure clear speaker identification in audio-only format

Audio Guidelines: Ensure all characters have distinctive vocal characteristics including pitch, pace, and speech patterns for clear audio identification

============================================================
GENRE APPROPRIATENESS ANALYSIS
============================================================
Status: FAIL
Genre: Unknown

Issues Found:
  - tone_inconsistency: Primary genre not defined, making genre-appropriate language assessment impossible
    Severity: critical
    Location: Project Context
    Recommendation: Define primary genre to establish appropriate language style, tone, and vocabulary

Genre Guidelines: Genre guidelines cannot be established without knowing the primary genre

============================================================
VOICE DIRECTION RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================
CHARACTER VOICE NOTES:

Character: Placeholder Character
Voice Description: Voice characteristics to be defined based on Character Bible
Speech Patterns: Speech patterns to be established during character development
Key Phrases: To be determined
Emotional Range: To be defined in Character Bible
Audio Notes: Each character must have distinct vocal characteristics for audio identification

Casting Guidelines: Cast voice actors who can maintain consistent character voices across all episodes and create distinct character differentiations

Production Notes: Record voice reference samples for each character to ensure consistency across all episodes

============================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
============================================================
IMMEDIATE FIXES REQUIRED:
  • Develop comprehensive Character Bible with detailed voice signatures for all characters
  • Define target age range for age-appropriate language assessment
  • Establish primary genre for genre-appropriate language guidelines

SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:
  • Create detailed World Building documentation to establish cultural and regional speech patterns
  • Develop episode outlines to assess dialogue and voice consistency needs

MINOR ADJUSTMENTS:
  • Consider narrator strategy and how it will interact with character voices
  • Plan for voice actor direction sessions to establish character voices

============================================================
VALIDATION NOTES
============================================================
Comprehensive dialect planning cannot be completed without essential project elements including Character Bible, World Building, episode outlines, defined target age, and established genre. These foundational elements must be developed before meaningful voice consistency and dialect planning can occur.
