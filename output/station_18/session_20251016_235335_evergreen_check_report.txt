üö® IMMEDIATE FIXES:

‚ö†Ô∏è  SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS:
1. Consider developing the theme of moral responsibility more deeply across episodes
2. Strengthen the exploration of how special abilities affect human connection

üìù MINOR ADJUSTMENTS:
1. Make Alex's profession more generic to ensure future-proofing
2. Consider framing the thought-hearing ability in a more culturally universal way

üìã VALIDATION NOTES
----------------------------------------
The episode outline demonstrates strong evergreen qualities with universal themes and timeless language. The primary concerns are the inconsistency between characters in the bible versus the episode outline, and potential cultural interpretations of the supernatural element. The story's focus on moral responsibility, human connection, and personal growth provides excellent timeless appeal. With minor adjustments to address the character inconsistency and slight reframing of the supernatural ability, this content has strong evergreen potential.
