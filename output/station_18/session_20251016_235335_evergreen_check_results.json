  "validation_notes": "The episode outline demonstrates strong evergreen qualities with universal themes and timeless language. The primary concerns are the inconsistency between characters in the bible versus the episode outline, and potential cultural interpretations of the supernatural element. The story's focus on moral responsibility, human connection, and personal growth provides excellent timeless appeal. With minor adjustments to address the character inconsistency and slight reframing of the supernatural ability, this content has strong evergreen potential.",
