  "validation_notes": "The provided materials demonstrate good accuracy across legal, medical, professional, and technical areas. Character professions are appropriately depicted with realistic traits, speech patterns, and workplace environments. The supernatural element of hearing thoughts is presented as such, with no attempt at technical justification which maintains credibility. The compressed timeline in Episode 1 is acceptable for dramatic purposes. No critical issues were identified that would impact audience immersion or credibility. Future episodes depicting medical scenarios would benefit from professional consultation to maintain accuracy.",
