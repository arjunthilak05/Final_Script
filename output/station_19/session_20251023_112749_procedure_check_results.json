        "current_depiction": "Julia takes charge of critical emergencies using confidence gained from messages, successfully managing crises with limited resources",
        "accurate_alternative": "In actual ER settings, nurses would follow established protocols with clear hierarchies. While nurses do take initiative, they would still work within a team structure with physicians making key medical decisions. Julia could demonstrate leadership but would operate within these professional boundaries",

A direct questioning by an administrator would usually be preceded by documented concerns and follow specific protocols",

  "validation_notes": "The series maintains overall credibility in its depiction of professional environments, with some areas needing refinement for greater accuracy. The medical scenarios, particularly in the ER setting, would benefit from more detailed and accurate representation of nursing roles and hospital procedures. Julia's character arc dealing with depression could be strengthened by showing a more comprehensive treatment approach. The life coaching and corporate executive elements are generally credible but would benefit from more specific details about these professions. The timeline and pacing of character developments are realistic and appropriate for the narrative.",
