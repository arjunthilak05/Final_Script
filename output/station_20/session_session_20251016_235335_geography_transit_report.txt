üìç LOCATION CONSISTENCY VALIDATION ISSUES
---------------------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Major character inconsistency between original seed and episode outline
  Severity: critical
  Location: Entire Episode 1
  Recommendation: Rewrite Episode 1 to feature the correct characters (Tom and Julia) and align with the original story concept of a morning motivation coach unknowingly texting inspirational messages to an ER doctor

üîß CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED
------------------------------
‚Ä¢ Rewrite Episode 1 to feature the correct characters (Tom and Julia) as established in the original seed and world bible

üí° SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
-------------------------
‚Ä¢ Add specific weather conditions to Episode 1 to maintain consistency with the rainy climate established in the World Bible
‚Ä¢ Consider adding more specific details about the city's layout to enhance geographical realism

üìù VALIDATION NOTES
--------------------
The most critical issue is the complete character inconsistency between the original seed (featuring Tom and Julia) and Episode 1 (featuring Alex). This fundamental disconnect needs to be addressed before any other geographical or transit concerns. Beyond this issue, the geographical elements and transit times appear generally consistent and realistic for an urban setting. The audio elements are well-designed to create immersive environments for each location.
