Issue_Type,Severity,Location,Description,Recommendation
Travel Time,warning,Episode 5, Scene 5,"Tom's visit to the hospital in Episode 5, Scene 5 doesn't account for realistic travel time and hospital navigation complexity","Add dialogue or sound elements indicating more time has passed, or specify that Tom is asking general questions about exceptional staff members rather than trying to access specific information"
Weather Consistency,warning,Episode 4, Scene 1 to Episode 4, Scene 2,"Weather changes abruptly between scenes without sufficient narrative justification","Add a brief mention of weather change or include subtle audio cues like damp streets or umbrellas in Tom's scene if rain was recent"
Location Consistency,warning,Episode 5, Scene 3 and Scene 5,"The administrative offices are depicted as easily accessible from the ER and public areas, which is unusual in most hospitals","Add dialogue indicating Julia was summoned to a meeting with advance notice, or specify that Dr. Martinez escorted Tom to a public information desk rather than allowing access to restricted areas"
Audio Geography,warning,Multiple ER scenes,"ER soundscapes don't adequately reflect the varying levels of activity throughout the day","Vary the intensity and types of ER sounds based on time of day and specific emergency situations mentioned in the script"
