INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATE EVENING

[SFX: ambient_home_evening, faint_typing, occasional_distant_traffic]

[ALEX is sitting at his desk, surrounded by sound equipment. His apartment is cozy, with a few personal items scattered around.]

ALEX
(whispering to himself)
Come on, just a few more tweaks...

[SFX: sound_mixer_beeps, keyboard_taps]

[ALEX adjusts a few settings on his sound mixer, listening intently to the audio playing through his headphones.]

ALEX
(muttering)
Almost there... Perfect.

[SFX: typing_stops, satisfied_sigh]

ALEX
(to himself)
Time to send it off.

[SFX: computer_click, email_notification]

ALEX
(satisfied)
Done. That should do it.

EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

[SFX: city_night, distant_car_horns, footsteps]

[ALEX walks down the city streets, his headphones around his neck. The night is cool, and the city is bustling with activity.]

ALEX
(thoughtfully)
What was that? It sounded so familiar...

[SFX: faint_static, footsteps]

[ALEX stops, pulling out his phone and fiddling with the settings.]

ALEX
(muttering)
Must have picked up some interference...

[SFX: static_increases, distant_sirens]

ALEX
(alarmed)
Wait, is that...?

[SFX: static_peaks, sudden_silence]

ALEX
(confused)
What the...?

[SFX: city_night_fades_out, footsteps_resume]

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING

[SFX: ambient_home_night, faint_static]

[ALEX returns to his apartment, looking puzzled. He sits down at his desk and starts reviewing the audio files on his computer.]

ALEX
(to himself)
It couldn't have been... No, it was just static, right?

[SFX: computer_clicks, file_opening]

ALEX
(whispering)
But what if it wasn't?

[ALEX plays back the audio file, listening closely.]

ALEX
(alarmed)
That's not static... That's a voice!

[SFX: faint_static, voice_distorted (filtered)]

DISTORTED VOICE
(whispering, distant)
...need help...

ALEX
(shocked)
Who is that?!

[SFX: file_stop, rapid_keyboard_taps]

ALEX
(determined)
I need to figure this out.

[SFX: ambient_home_night_fades_out, faint_static_continues]

INT. ALEX'S APARTMENT - EARLY MORNING

[SFX: ambient_home_morning, faint_static, coffee_machine_hissing]

[ALEX is now pacing around his apartment, a cup of coffee in hand. He looks stressed and deep in thought.]

ALEX
(to himself)
What if it's real? What if someone really needs help?

[SFX: coffee_sip, pacing_footsteps]

ALEX
(determined)
I can't just ignore it. I need to find out more.

[SFX: computer_turns_on, file_opening]

ALEX
(resolute)
I'll trace the source, and if it's real, I'll do whatever it takes to help.

[SFX: ambient_home_morning_fades_out, computer_hum]
