[SFX: FOOTSTEPS STOP. DR. MARTINEZ'S VOICE IS CLEARER NOW.]

DR. MARTINEZ
The Miller case. Family wants to speak with someone about transition options. I thought with your background in palliative care...

JULIA
(abruptly)
I can't.

DR. MARTINEZ
(surprised)
Is everything alright?

JULIA
(quickly)
I'm just—swamped. Ask Linda. She's better with that sort of thing.

Did someone say my name?

Julia, you usually handle these so well.

(evasive)
I have that report due, remember?

Just heard from Sarah—the one who was struggling with the career change?

TOM
(optimistic)
And?

MARK
She took the leap! Quit her job, enrolled in that design program. Said your coaching gave her the courage.

TOM
(warmly)
That's what we do—help people find their path.

MARK
You're growing the business fast. We've already hit our quarterly target.

TOM
It's not about targets, Mark. It's about lives changed.

[SFX: KEYBOARD TAPPING.]

MARK
Right, but... you need to think about scaling. Maybe bring on another coach?

Maybe. Right now, I like the personal touch. Each message... each call... matters.
