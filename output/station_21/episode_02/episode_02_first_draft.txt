INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]

[FADE IN]

MARCUS COLE (mumbling to himself, pacing) I can't believe I'm doing this. What the hell am I thinking?

[MARCUS' footsteps, lighter_click]

MARCUS (whispering) If I tell them, they'll know. I can't let them know.

[DOOR KNOB TURNS, DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

RODRIGUEZ (O.S., cautious) Marcus? You in there?

[MARCUS FREEZES, BREATHES DEEPLY]

MARCUS (strained) Yeah, I'm here. What do you want, Rodriguez?

RODRIGUEZ (entering, footsteps) I need to talk to you. It's important.

[MARCUS' NERVOUS BREATHING]

MARCUS (hesitant) Can't it wait? I'm kind of busy.

RODRIGUEZ (concerned) This can't wait, Marcus. It's about the case.

[MARCUS' HEAVY SIGH]

MARCUS (defeated) Fine. What is it?

[RODRIGUEZ' FOOTSTEPS, DOOR CLOSES]

RODRIGUEZ (serious) We found something at the scene. Something that doesn't add up.

[MARCUS' HEARTBEAT SOUNDS LOUDER]

MARCUS (nervous) What kind of something?

RODRIGUEZ (determined) I need you to come with me. We need to talk about this in person.

[MARCUS' RELUCTANT SIGH]

MARCUS (resigned) Alright. Let's go.

[FADE OUT]

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_police_station, distant_sirens, typing]

[FADE IN]

MARCUS and RODRIGUEZ enter the police station. The sound of typing and distant sirens fill the air.

RODRIGUEZ (leading Marcus, low) We need to be careful. This could get us into trouble.

MARCUS (whispering) I don't like this, Rodriguez. What are we doing here?

RODRIGUEZ (serious) Trust me, Marcus. This is important.

[DOOR CREAKS OPEN, FOOTSTEPS]

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (O.S., stern) Rodriguez, what are you doing here at this hour?

[MARCUS TENSES]

RODRIGUEZ (calm) Detective, this is Marcus Cole. He's here to help us with the case.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (skeptical) Help us? How?

[MARCUS' NERVOUS BREATHING]

MARCUS (unsteady) I... I might have seen something.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (intrigued) What did you see?

[MARCUS' HEARTBEAT SOUNDS LOUDER]

MARCUS (hesitant) I... I can't say. Not yet.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (firm) Marcus, if you know something, you need to tell us now.

[MARCUS' HEAVY SIGH]

MARCUS (defeated) I need some time to think. Please.

RODRIGUEZ (reassuring) We'll give you the time you need, Marcus. Just remember, the truth will come out eventually.

[PAUSE]

MARCUS (resigned) I know.

[FADE OUT]

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]

[FADE IN]

MARCUS is back in his apartment, pacing nervously. The sound of rain and distant traffic continues.

MARCUS (muttering to himself) What am I going to do? I can't keep this a secret forever.

[PAUSE]

MARCUS (determined) No, I have to tell them. I have to do the right thing.

[DOOR KNOB TURNS, DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

RODRIGUEZ (O.S., cautious) Marcus? It's me again.

[MARCUS FREEZES, BREATHES DEEPLY]

MARCUS (strained) Come in, Rodriguez.

RODRIGUEZ (entering, footsteps) I'm here to listen, Marcus. Whatever it is, we can handle it together.

[MARCUS' NERVOUS BREATHING]

MARCUS (hesitant) I... I saw the killer. I saw him run from the scene.

RODRIGUEZ (surprised) You saw the killer? Are you sure?

MARCUS (nodding) Yes. I'm sure. But I didn't tell anyone because...

[PAUSE]

MARCUS (struggles) Because I was there. I was at the scene. I... I could be a suspect.

RODRIGUEZ (reassuring) Marcus, you're not a suspect. You're a witness. We need your help to catch this guy.

[MARCUS' HEAVY SIGH]

MARCUS (resigned) I know. I'll tell them everything.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_police_station, distant_sirens, typing]

[FADE IN]

MARCUS and RODRIGUEZ enter the police station. The sound of typing and distant sirens continues.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (serious) Marcus, you're here. What do you have for us?

[MARCUS' NERVOUS BREATHING]

MARCUS (hesitant) I... I saw the killer. I saw him run from the scene.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (surprised) You saw the killer? Are you sure?

MARCUS (nodding) Yes. I'm sure. But I was there too. I was at the scene.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (concerned) You were at the scene? Why didn't you say anything earlier?

MARCUS (defeated) I was scared. I didn't want to be a suspect.

RODRIGUEZ (reassuring) Detective, Marcus is a witness, not a suspect. We need to focus on the killer.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (nodding) I understand. Marcus, tell us everything you saw.

[MARCUS' HEAVY SIGH]

MARCUS (calm) I was walking home late that night. I saw a man running from the building where the crime happened. He was wearing a black hoodie and jeans. He was tall and thin. I only saw his profile, but I think I can identify him.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (writing notes) Good. Very good. Do you have any other details?

MARCUS (thinking) He had a distinctive walk. It was like he was limping slightly.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (nodding) That's helpful. We'll put out a BOLO for a man matching that description.

[MARCUS' RELUCTANT SIGH]

MARCUS (resigned) I'm sorry I didn't come forward sooner.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (reassuring) It's okay, Marcus. You did the right thing. We'll take it from here.

[FADE OUT]

INT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]

[FADE IN]

MARCUS is back in his apartment, sitting on the couch. The sound of rain and distant traffic continues. He lights a cigarette, the sound of the lighter_click is distinct.

MARCUS (muttering to himself) I did the right thing. I had to.

[DOOR KNOB TURNS, DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

RODRIGUEZ (O.S., cautious) Marcus? It's me.

[MARCUS FREEZES, BREATHES DEEPLY]

MARCUS (strained) Come in, Rodriguez.

RODRIGUEZ (entering, footsteps) How are you holding up?

[MARCUS' NERVOUS BREATHING]

MARCUS (unsteady) I'm... I'm okay. Just a bit shaken up.

RODRIGUEZ (reassuring) You did the right thing, Marcus. We'll catch this guy.

[MARCUS' HEAVY SIGH]

MARCUS (resigned) I hope so. I really hope so.

[PAUSE]

RODRIGUEZ (serious) Marcus, if anything else comes up, you need to let me know immediately.

MARCUS (nodding) I will. I promise.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (muttering to himself) This is a breakthrough. We have a witness. We have a description. We'll find this guy.

[DOOR KNOB TURNS, DOOR CREAKS OPEN]

RODRIGUEZ (O.S., cautious) Detective?

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (turns, hopeful) Rodriguez. Any news?

RODRIGUEZ (serious) Not yet. But we're working on it. Marcus' information is crucial.

DETECTIVE HAWKINS (nodding) I know. Keep me updated.
