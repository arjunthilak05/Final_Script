TOM: (muttering to himself) Alright, let's get this show on the road. (pauses, clicks his pen) One message at a time.

[SFX: Keyboard typing, light clicks of the pen]

TOM: (into phone) Good morning, Sarah. I know you're having a tough time, but remember, you’re stronger than you think. (pauses) Keep pushing forward. (pauses) I believe in you. (types on laptop, satisfied)
