INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - EVENING

[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]

TOM (thinking aloud, pacing) Why isn't she getting the messages? I checked the system, everything's fine. It’s like they’re vanishing into thin air. (sighs) I need to figure this out before it’s too late.

[SFX: lighter_click, Tom’s pacing slows]

TOM (muttering) It has to be a glitch. But what if it’s something more? (pauses, looks out the window) Julia, I swear I’ll find out what’s happening.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_hospital, heart_monitor, footsteps, urgent_voices]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we need to intubate now! Her oxygen levels are dropping.

[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia’s quick movements]

JULIA (strained, focused) I’m in position. (pauses, deep breath) Here we go.

MIKE (O.S., calm) Good, good. Keep going, Julia.

[SFX: heart_monitor_beep_accelerates, Julia’s breathing]

JULIA (strained) Almost... (pauses, tension) Got it! (relief) She’s stable.

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., relieved) Great work, everyone. (pauses, softer) Julia, you did well.

JULIA (whispers, to herself) I couldn’t save her.

INT. HOSPITAL STAFF ROOM - LATE NIGHT

[SFX: ambient_hospital, faint_heart_monitor, soft_crying]

JULIA (whispering, to herself) Why couldn’t I save her? (pauses, sobs) I should have done more.

[SFX: door_creaks, footsteps]

DR. MARTINEZ (soft, concerned) Julia, you did everything you could. (pauses, approaches) Sometimes, it’s out of our hands.

JULIA (whispers) I know. (pauses, wipes tears) But it doesn’t make it any easier.

DR. MARTINEZ (reassuring) You’re one of the best doctors I know. Don’t doubt yourself.

JULIA (nods, sighs) Thanks, Dr. Martinez. (pauses, stands up) I’ll be okay.

INT. TOM'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

[SFX: ambient_office, phone_ringing, keyboard_tapping]

LENA (O.S., professional) Tom, you’re here early.

TOM (serious, determined) Lena, we need to talk. (pauses, sits down) I made a mistake with the messages. (pauses, looks at Lena) I didn’t realize how critical it was.

LENA (concerned) What do you mean?

TOM (explains) The system’s been sending messages, but they’re not reaching the intended recipient. (pauses, frustrated) I don’t know why, but I’m going to find out.

LENA (nodding) Okay, let’s go through the logs. Maybe we can trace the issue.

TOM (resolute) Thanks, Lena. I owe this to Julia.

INT. TOM'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

[SFX: ambient_office, keyboard_tapping, paper_rustling]

LENA (O.S., focused) I’ve been looking through the logs, and there’s a pattern. (pauses, points to screen) The messages are being rerouted to an unknown recipient. (pauses, concerned) It’s like someone’s intercepting them.

TOM (shocked, stands up) What? How is that possible? (pauses, determined) We need to find out who’s behind this.

LENA (nodding) I agree. I’ll run a trace on the unknown address. (pauses, typing) It might take some time.

TOM (resolute) We don’t have time. (pauses, looks at Lena) Julia’s life could be in danger.

LENA (determined) I’ll do whatever it takes. (pauses, typing) Let’s get to work.

INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON

[SFX: ambient_hospital, heart_monitor, urgent_voices]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we have another critical case. (pauses, approaches) Can you handle it?

JULIA (determined, professional) Yes, I can. (pauses, takes a deep breath) Let’s do this.

[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia’s quick movements]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., calm) Good. (pauses, softer) Take your time, Julia. (pauses, encouraging) You’ve got this.

JULIA (focused) I’m ready. (pauses, confident) Let’s save this patient.
