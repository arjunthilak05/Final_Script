    "pacing_summary": "The episode has a generally steady pace, but there are areas where the energy flatlines, particularly in the opening scenes and during repetitive moments. The transitions between locations and scenes could be smoother, and the repetitive rhythm can be addressed by introducing more variation in character interactions and internal monologues. Overall, the episode could benefit from more dynamic and varied pacing to keep the audience engaged throughout."
