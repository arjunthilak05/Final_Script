The most significant problems are slow sections in Scenes 2 and 5 where the action lacks escalation, and rushed transitions between scenes that could disorient listeners. The repetitive structure of scenes and scene endings also creates a predictable rhythm that could reduce engagement. With some adjustments to streamline slow sections, add transitional elements, and vary the scene structure, this episode could maintain stronger momentum throughout."
