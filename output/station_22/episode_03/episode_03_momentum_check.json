    "pacing_summary": "Episode 3 has a generally good momentum, but there are a few areas where the pacing can be improved. The internal monologue in Scene 1 is a bit slow, the transition to Scene 2 is abrupt, there is a brief period of dead air in Scene 3, and the repetitive structure in Scene 4 can make the episode feel predictable. Addressing these issues can enhance the overall flow and keep the audience more engaged."
