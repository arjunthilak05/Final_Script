1. [PLANT_ADDITION] Scene 4
   P3 Marker: P_MC_001
   Technique: Integrated the lighter click as a nervous habit during a tense moment to make it feel natural.

2. [PAYOFF_FIX] Scene 9
   P3 Marker: P_MC_002
   Technique: Converted the explicit admission to a more ambiguous statement, hinting at guilt without confirming it.

3. [MISDIRECTION_BALANCE] Scene 4
   P3 Marker: P_MC_003
   Technique: Added an innocent explanation for his nervous behavior by suggesting he feels watched, which could be a logical reason for his actions.
