It's important to set boundaries and take care of yourself. Have you tried any of the techniques we discussed?\n\nSARAH (O.S., hopeful)\nI've been trying the deep breathing, but it's hard to focus.\n\nTOM\n(Kindly)\nThat's totally normal.

She puts on her gloves and prepares for the critical case.\n\nDR. LEE (40s, authoritative)\n(Jumping in, professional)\nJulia, we need you to assist with the patient in Bay 3. It's a severe trauma case.\n\nJULIA\n(Professional, focused)\nI'm ready. What's the situation?\n\nDR. LEE\n(Concerned)\nMultiple injuries, potential internal bleeding. We need to stabilize the patient before we can transport them to surgery.\n\nJULIA\n(Determined)\nUnderstood. I'll get the IV started and monitor vitals.\n\n[SFX: Julia's quick, efficient movements, the sound of a syringe, the beeping of medical equipment.]\n\nNURSE LINDA (O.S., professional)\nBlood pressure is dropping. We need to act fast.\n\nJULIA\n(Calm, focused)\nI'm on it. Administering fluids.\n\n[SFX: The sound of fluids being administered, the beeping of the heart monitor.]\n\nDR. LEE\n(Encouraging)\nGood work, Julia. Keep it up.\n\nJULIA\n(Professional)\nVitals are stabilizing. We need to get them to surgery now.\n\nDR. LEE\n(Decisive)\nRight. Let's move.\n\n[SFX: The sound of the team moving the patient, urgent commands, the whoosh of a stretcher.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, urgently)\nHang in there, just a little longer...\n\n[SFX: Urgent medical sounds, the patient being wheeled into the operating room, the door closing with a definitive slam.]\n\nDR. LEE\n(Exhaling, calmer but still professional)\nGood job, team. We saved a life today. Dr. Martinez will be pleased with the outcome.\n\nJULIA\n(Exhausted but relieved, with a slight hesitation)\nThank you, Dr. Lee. I couldn't have done it without you all. I should probably check in with Dr. Martinez about those unusual circumstances he mentioned.\n\nDR. LEE\n(Smiling, encouraging)\nYou're a vital part of this team, Julia. Keep it up.\n\nJULIA\n(Smiling, grateful)\nI will. Thanks.\n\n[SFX: Julia's footsteps as she walks to the staff room, slowing with exhaustion.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, resolute)\nEvery life matters.\n\n[SFX: Door opens and closes as Julia enters the staff room.]\n\nTRANSITION: [SFX: Door closes, ambient hospital sounds fade out, home sounds fade in.]\n\n=== SCENE 6: INT. JULIA'S HOME - EVENING ===\n[SFX: Ambient home sounds, gentle hum of a fan, the sound of a kettle boiling.]\n\nJULIA sits on her couch, a cup of tea in her hands. She looks tired but reflective.\n\n[SFX: Kettle whistling.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, quietly)\nAnother day, another challenge.\n\n[SFX: Julia pours herself a cup of tea, the sound of the liquid sloshing.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, thoughtful)\nI did my best today. That's all I can do.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates on the coffee table.]\n\nJULIA\n(Curious, picking up the phone)\nAnother unknown number? Same wrong person message. This is the second time today...\n\n[SFX: Julia reads the message, the sound of her phone.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, thoughtful)\nWhat are the odds of getting the same wrong number twice?\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates again as she types a quick reply.]\n\nJULIA\n(Typing, to herself)\nNo worries, happens to the best of us.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone beeps, confirming the message was sent.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, determined)\nEvery day brings new challenges.\n\n[SFX: Julia takes a sip of her tea, the sound of the liquid, then sets the cup down with a soft clink.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, reflective)\nAnd new opportunities to grow.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates again, a different ringtone.]\n\nJULIA\n(Surprised, hopeful)\nHello?\n\nTOM (O.S., warm)\nHi, Julia. It's Tom. How are you?\n\nJULIA\n(Surprised, but grateful)\nHi, Tom. I'm doing okay. Thanks for checking in.\n\nTOM (O.S., kind)\nI wanted to make sure you were okay after our call earlier. Is everything alright?\n\nJULIA\n(Smiling, honest)\nIt's been a tough day, but I'm hanging in there. Thank you for asking.\n\nTOM (O.S., encouraging)\nThat's good to hear. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here.\n\nJULIA\n(Grateful)\nThank you, Tom. That means a lot.\n\nTOM (O.S., warm)\nAnytime, Julia. Take care.\n\nJULIA\n(Smiling, hopeful)\nYou too, Tom.\n\n[SFX: Phone hangs up.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, reflective)\nMaybe there's more to this than just a wrong number.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates as she puts it down.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, determined)\nEvery day brings new challenges.\n\n[SFX: Julia's footsteps as she stands up and walks to the window.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, hopeful)\nAnd new opportunities to grow.\n\nTRANSITION: [SFX: Door closes, ambient home sounds fade out, credits music fades in.]",
