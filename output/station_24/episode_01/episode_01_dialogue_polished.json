Expecting something important?\n\nSARAH (O.S., hesitant)\nI think it's the stress at work. My boss is really pushing me, and I feel overwhelmed.\n\nTOM\n(Reassuring)\nThat sounds overwhelming. Setting boundaries might help. Have the breathing techniques offered any relief?\n\nSARAH (O.S., hopeful)\nI've been trying the deep breathing, but it's hard to focus.\n\nTOM\n(Kindly)\nTotally normal. Let's try a guided meditation. Might help center you.\n\n[SFX: Tom's phone plays a soft, calming meditation audio.]\n\nTOM\n(Gentle, guiding)\nTake a deep breath in... and out... In... and out...\n\n[SFX: Sarah's breathing becomes more relaxed.]\n\nSARAH (O.S., calmer)\nI feel a bit better. Thank you, Tom.\n\nTOM\n(Smiling, reassured)\nYou're welcome. Remember, you're not alone. I'm here to support you.\n\nSARAH (O.S., grateful)\nThank you. I'll try to stay positive.\n\nTOM\n(Encouraging)\nThat's the spirit. I'll check in later this week.
