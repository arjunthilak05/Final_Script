Thanks.\n\n[SFX: Julia's footsteps as she walks to the staff room, slowing with exhaustion.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, resolute)\nEvery life matters.\n\n[SFX: Door opens and closes as Julia enters the staff room.]\n\nTRANSITION: [SFX: Door closes, ambient hospital sounds fade out, home sounds fade in.]\n\n=== SCENE 6: INT. JULIA'S HOME - EVENING ===\n[SFX: Ambient home sounds, gentle hum of a fan, the sound of a kettle boiling.]\n\nJULIA sits on her couch, a cup of tea in her hands. She looks tired but reflective.\n\n[SFX: Kettle whistling.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, quietly)\nAnother day, another challenge.\n\n[SFX: Julia pours herself a cup of tea, the sound of the liquid sloshing.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, thoughtful)\nDid my best today. That's all I can do.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates on the coffee table.]\n\nJULIA\n(Curious, picking up the phone)\nAnother unknown number? Same wrong person message. This is the second time today...\n\n[SFX: Julia reads the message, the sound of her phone.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, thoughtful)\nWhat are the odds of getting the same wrong number twice?\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates again as she types a quick reply.]\n\nJULIA\n(Typing, to herself)\nNo worries, happens to the best of us.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone beeps, confirming the message was sent.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, determined)\nAnother day, another challenge.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates again, a different ringtone.]\n\nJULIA\n(Surprised, hopeful)\nHello?\n\nTOM (O.S., warm)\nHi, Julia. It's Tom. How are you?\n\nJULIA\n(Surprised, but grateful)\nHi, Tom. I'm doing okay. Thanks for checking in.\n\nTOM (O.S., kind)\nI wanted to make sure you were okay after our call earlier. Is everything alright?\n\nJULIA\n(Smiling, honest)\nIt's been a tough day, but I'm hanging in there. Thank you for asking.\n\nTOM (O.S., encouraging)\nThat's good to hear. If you ever need someone to talk to, I'm here.\n\nJULIA\n(Grateful)\nThank you, Tom. That means a lot.\n\nTOM (O.S., warm)\nAnytime, Julia. Take care.\n\nJULIA\n(Smiling, hopeful)\nYou too, Tom.\n\n[SFX: Phone hangs up.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, reflective)\nMaybe there's more to this than just a wrong number.\n\n[SFX: Julia's phone vibrates as she puts it down.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, determined)\nAnother day, another challenge.\n\n[SFX: Julia's footsteps as she stands up and walks to the window.]\n\nJULIA\n(To herself, hopeful)\nAnd new opportunities to grow.\n\nTRANSITION: [SFX: Door closes, ambient home sounds fade out, credits music fades in.]",
