TOM, in his mid-30s, is in his living room, dressed in casual clothes. He walks to his desk, where a laptop and a smartphone are set up.]\n\nTOM: (muttering to himself) Alright, let's get this show on the road. (pauses, clicks his pen) One message at a time. (glances at a photo on his desk showing him in medical scrubs)\n\n[SFX: Keyboard typing, light clicks of the pen]\n\nTOM: (into phone) Good morning, Sarah. (pauses) I remember when I was in your shoes. (pauses) You've got this. (pauses) Keep pushing forward. (pauses) I believe in you. (types on laptop, satisfied) After what we went through, I know you can handle anything.\n\n[SFX: Notification sound, phone screen lights up]\n\nTOM: (smiling) One down, a few more to go. (types more messages)\n\n[SFX: Fading keyboard typing, soft ambient sounds]\n\nTOM: (softly) I hope these words make a difference.

(phone buzzes with new message, she reads it) 'You've got this, Julia. You're a hero to your patients.' (sits up, intrigued) Who... who are you? (pauses, looks at a hospital ID badge on her nightstand) How do you know my name? (pauses, types a response) Thanks.\n\n[SFX: Phone screen dims, quick rustling of sheets as Julia throws off covers]\n\nJULIA: (to herself, with determination) I need to be strong. For them.

Mike, assist her. (to JULIA) Stay calm, focus.\n\n[SFX: Stretchers being wheeled in, urgent voices, beeping monitors]\n\nJULIA: (determined) Got it. (to MIKE) Move, Mike. (they move quickly)\n\nMIKE: (nervously tapping his phone in his pocket) Yeah, Doctor. I've never... never seen this many cases at once. (stutters) What do we do?\n\nJULIA: (calm) One step at a time. (to a nurse) We need a full assessment, vitals, and start an IV. (pauses) Mike, help with the IV. (pauses) We can do this.\n\n[SFX: IV being set up, rapid breathing, beeping monitors]\n\nMIKE: (whispering) I hope so. (pauses, glances at his phone) Doctor, the patient's blood pressure is dropping. (quickly puts phone away, focuses on patient)\n\nJULIA: (focused) Increase the IV rate and prep for a blood transfusion. (pauses) Keep me updated. (pauses) You're doing great.

MARTINEZ is sitting at a table, looking tired. JULIA stands by the window, looking out.]\n\nDR. MARTINEZ: (sighing) You handled it. (pauses) Not easy, but you managed.\n\nJULIA: (softly) Thank you, Dr. Martinez. (looks out the window, then back at him) It's just... some days are... harder than others. I keep thinking about the patients and their families. It's a lot.\n\nDR. MARTINEZ: (encouraging) You're making a difference. One patient at a time. Remember that.\n\nJULIA: (nodding, starts pacing) I will. I just... (stops pacing, looks at him intently) I feel like I need more. Those messages I've been getting... (intercom buzzes again) They're helping somehow. I'll figure it out. Thanks for believing in me.\n\nDR. MARTINEZ: (smiling) Always. (pauses) Take a moment to breathe. You've earned it. (pauses) We all have.\n\n[SFX: Soft ambient sounds, distant beeping]\n\n=== SCENE 5: INT.

He startles as his office phone rings, then checks his personal phone with concern.]\n\nTOM: (muttering, ignores ringing office phone) Where are you? (quickly types a message, glances at ringing phone) I hope you're doing okay. (sighs, answers office phone briefly) Mr. Henderson, I'll call you right back. (returns to personal phone) Remember to take breaks when you can. (pauses, puts the phone down)\n\n[SFX: Phone screen dims, office phone rings again]\n\nTOM: (to himself, stands up) I hope you're doing alright. (grabs jacket, looks at phone again) You're not alone.

(continues scrolling, stops) 'You've got this.' (sits up straighter) Who are you, really? (pauses, types more) Your messages mean a lot. (pauses, hits send)\n\n[SFX: Phone screen lights up, notification sound]\n\nJULIA: (to herself, standing up) I need to know. (paces room, phone in hand) Maybe this will help.
