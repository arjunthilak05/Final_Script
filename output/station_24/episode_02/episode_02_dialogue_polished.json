(they move quickly)\n\nMIKE: (nervously tapping his phone in his pocket) Yes, Doctor. (pauses) Never seen this many cases at once. (stutters) What do we do?\n\nJULIA: (calm) One step at a time. (to a nurse) Full assessment. Vitals. And start an IV. (pauses) Mike, assist with the IV. (pauses) We will do this.\n\n[SFX: IV being set up, rapid breathing, beeping monitors]\n\nMIKE: (whispering) I hope so.

(pauses) It's not easy, but you handled it with grace.\n\nJULIA: (softly) Thank you, Dr. Martinez. (looks out the window, then back at him) It's just... (intercom buzzes loudly) Some days are harder than others. (rises to answer intercom) I keep thinking about the patients and their families. (pauses) It's a lot.\n\nDR. MARTINEZ: (encouraging) You're making a difference, you know? One patient at a time. Just remember that.\n\nJULIA: (nodding, starts pacing) I will. I just... (stops pacing, looks at him intently) I feel like I need more. Those messages I've been getting... (intercom buzzes again) They're helping somehow. I'll figure it out. Thanks for believing in me.\n\nDR. MARTINEZ: (smiling) Always. (pauses) Take a moment to breathe. You've earned it. (pauses) We all have.\n\n[SFX: Soft ambient sounds, distant beeping]\n\n=== SCENE 5: INT.

(quickly types a message, glances at ringing phone) Just wanted to see how your day is going. Hope work isn't too stressful. (sighs, answers office phone briefly) Mr. Henderson... I'll call you right back. (returns to personal phone) Remember to take breaks when you can.

(continues scrolling, stops) 'You've got this.' (sits up straighter) Who are you? (pauses, types more) Means a lot. Your messages. (pauses, hits send)\n\n[SFX: Phone screen lights up, notification sound]\n\nJULIA: (to herself, standing up) I need to know. (paces room, phone in hand) Maybe this will help.
