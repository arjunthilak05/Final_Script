[SFX: Keyboard typing, light clicks of the pen]

TOM: (into phone) Good morning, Sarah. (pauses) I remember when I was in your shoes. (pauses) You've got this. (pauses) Keep pushing forward. (pauses) I believe in you. (types on laptop, satisfied) After what we went through, I know you can handle anything.

[SFX: Notification sound, phone screen lights up]

TOM: (smiling) One down, a few more to go. (types more messages)

JULIA: (rubbing her eyes) Another day. (phone buzzes with new message, she reads it) 'You've got this, Julia. You're a hero to your patients.' (sits up, intrigued) Who... who are you? (pauses, looks at a hospital ID badge on her nightstand) How do you know my name? (pauses, types a response) Thanks.

[SFX: Phone screen dims, quick rustling of sheets as Julia throws off covers]

[SFX: Stretchers being wheeled in, urgent voices, beeping monitors]

JULIA: (determined) Got it. (to MIKE) Move, Mike. (they move quickly)

MIKE: (nervously tapping his phone in his pocket) Yeah, Doctor. I've never... never seen this many cases at once. (stutters) What do we do?

JULIA: (calm) One step at a time. (to a nurse) We need a full assessment, vitals, and start an IV. (pauses) Mike, help with the IV. (pauses) We can do this.

[SFX: IV being set up, rapid breathing, beeping monitors]

MIKE: (whispering) I hope so. (pauses, glances at his phone) Doctor, the patient's blood pressure is dropping. (quickly puts phone away, focuses on patient)

DR. MARTINEZ: (sighing) You handled it. (pauses) Not easy, but you managed.

JULIA: (softly) Thank you, Dr. Martinez. (looks out the window, then back at him) It's just... some days are... harder than others. I keep thinking about the patients and their families. It's a lot.

DR. MARTINEZ: (encouraging) You're making a difference. One patient at a time. Remember that.

JULIA: (nodding, starts pacing) I will. I just... (stops pacing, looks at him intently) I feel like I need more. Those messages I've been getting... (intercom buzzes again) They're helping somehow. I'll figure it out. Thanks for believing in me.

DR. MARTINEZ: (smiling) Always. (pauses) Take a moment to breathe. You've earned it. (pauses) We all have.

(sighs, answers office phone briefly) Mr. Henderson, I'll call you right back. (returns to personal phone) Remember to take breaks when you can. (pauses, puts the phone down)

[SFX: Phone screen dims, office phone rings again]

[SFX: Phone screen lights up, notification sound]

JULIA: (to herself, standing up) I need to know. (paces room, phone in hand) Maybe this will help. (stops pacing, decisive) I hope so. (puts phone down, heads to kitchen) Time to relax and figure this out. (turns on small lamp, then coffee maker)
