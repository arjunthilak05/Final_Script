TOM'S APARTMENT - EVENING ===\n[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]\n\nTOM (thinking aloud, pacing) Why isn't she getting the messages? I checked the system, everything looks good. It's like they're just disappearing. (sighs) (glances at his computer screen showing a message interface with unusual error codes)\n\n[SFX: phone_vibrates urgently, Tom stops pacing]\n\nTOM (answering) Hello? (pauses, concerned) What do you mean she's not responding? (frustrated, slams fist on table) I've been sending messages all day! (hangs up, muttering) It's gotta be a glitch. But what if it's something more? (paces quickly to window) Julia, I swear I'll find out what's happening.\n\n=== SCENE 2: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT ===\n[SFX: ambient_hospital, heart_monitor, footsteps, urgent_voices]\n\nDR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we need to intubate now! Her oxygen levels are dropping.\n\n[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia's quick movements]\n\nJULIA (strained, focused) I'm in position. Here we go! (notices a familiar-looking face in the observation window, but focuses back on the patient)\n\nMIKE (O.S., calm) Good, good. Keep going, Julia.\n\n[SFX: heart_monitor_beep_accelerates, Julia's breathing, equipment_beeps]\n\nJULIA (strained) Almost... (grunts with effort) Got it! (panting slightly) She's stable?\n\n[SFX: heart_monitor_stabilizes]\n\nDR. MARTINEZ (O.S., relieved) Great work, everyone. Julia, you did well.\n\nJULIA (whispers, to herself, notices a distinctive ring on the patient's finger) I... I couldn't save her. (hands trembling, notices a distinctive ring on the patient's finger that looks familiar, walks away quickly)\n\n[SFX: pager_beeps urgently]\n\nDR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we need you in trauma room 2, stat!\n\n=== SCENE 3: INT. HOSPITAL STAFF ROOM - LATE NIGHT ===\n[SFX: ambient_hospital, faint_heart_monitor, soft_crying]\n\nJULIA (whispering, to herself, stares at the photo of a young woman) Why couldn't I save her? (looks at a photo on her phone of a young woman) I promised I'd always be there.\n\n[SFX: clock_ticks loudly, Julia sobs]\n\nJULIA (wipes tears) I should have done more.\n\n[SFX: door_creaks, footsteps approach]\n\nDR. MARTINEZ (soft, concerned) Julia, you did everything you could. (pauses, approaches) Sometimes, it's out of our hands.\n\nJULIA (whispers) I know. (pauses, wipes tears) But it doesn't make it any easier.\n\nDR. MARTINEZ (reassuring) You're one of the best doctors I know. Don't doubt yourself.\n\nJULIA (nods, sighs) Thanks, Dr. Martinez. (pauses, stands up) I'll be okay.\n\n=== SCENE 4: INT. TOM'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING ===\n[SFX: alarm_clock_rings, traffic_sounds, door_slams, footsteps_approach, phone_ringing]\n\nLENA (O.S., professional) Tom, you're here early.\n\nTOM (serious, determined) Lena, we need to talk. I made a mistake with the messages. (glances at his phone nervously) I didn't realize how critical it was until last night when—\n\n(SFX: phone_rings_intensely)\n\nLENA (concerned) What do you mean?\n\nTOM (explains) The system's been sending messages, but they're not reaching the intended recipient. I don't... I don't know why, but I'm going to find out.\n\nLENA (nodding) Okay, let's go through the logs. Maybe we can trace the issue.\n\nTOM (resolute) Thanks, Lena. I owe this to Julia.\n\n=== SCENE 5: INT. TOM'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON ===\n[SFX: ambient_office, keyboard_tapping, paper_rustling]\n\nLENA (O.S., focused) Tom, look at this! I've found a pattern in the logs. (keyboard_tapping_faster) The messages aren't just failing—there's some kind of redirection happening in the system. (voice drops) It's almost like they're being sent somewhere else first.\n\nTOM (shocked, stands up) What? How is that possible? (knocks over coffee cup) Damn it! (grabs jacket) This could be a major security breach. We need to protect the system before someone gets hurt!\n\n[SFX: computer_alerts, rapid_keyboarding]\n\nLENA (determined) I agree. I'll run a trace on the unknown address. (typing_faster) It might take some—\n\nTOM (interrupting) We don't have time! (leans over desk) Julia's life could be in danger.\n\nLENA (determined) I'll do whatever it takes. (typing) Let's get to work.\n\n=== SCENE 6: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON ===\n[SFX: ambulance_sirens_approaching, hospital_doors_burst_open, gurney_wheels, urgent_voices]\n\nDR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we have another critical case. Stat!\n\n[SFX: rapid_footsteps_approach]\n\nJULIA (determined, professional, notices a small scar on her arm) I'm ready.
