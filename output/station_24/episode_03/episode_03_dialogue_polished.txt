=== SCENE 1: INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - EVENING ===
[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]

TOM (thinking aloud, pacing) (taps repeatedly on send button, stares at screen) All sent. All delivered. All gone. (slams fist on desk)

[SFX: phone_vibrates urgently, Tom stops pacing]

TOM (answering) Hello? (pauses, concerned) What do you mean she's not responding? (frustrated) I've been sending messages all day! (hangs up, mutters) (stares out window at rain) Just a system error. Always just a system error. (grips windowsill tightly) Julia, I swear I'll find out what's happening.

=== SCENE 2: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT ===
[SFX: ambient_hospital, heart_monitor, footsteps, urgent_voices]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we've got to intubate now! Her oxygen levels are dropping.

[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia's quick movements]

JULIA (strained, focused) Positioned. Ready! (notices a familiar-looking face in the observation window, but focuses back on the patient)

MIKE (O.S., calm) Good, good. Keep going, Julia.

[SFX: heart_monitor_beep_accelerates, Julia's breathing, equipment_beeps]

JULIA (strained) Almost... (grunts with effort) Got it! (panting slightly) She's stable?

[SFX: heart_monitor_stabilizes]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., relieved) Great work, everyone. Julia, you did well.

JULIA (whispers, to herself) (stares at her hands, then quickly turns away) Next case.

[SFX: pager_beeps urgently]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we need you in trauma room 2, stat!

=== SCENE 3: INT. HOSPITAL STAFF ROOM - LATE NIGHT ===
[SFX: ambient_hospital, faint_heart_monitor, soft_crying]

JULIA (whispering, to herself) (tracing the photo with her finger) We had a deal.

[SFX: clock_ticks loudly, Julia sobs]

JULIA (wipes tears) I should have done more.

[SFX: door_creaks, footsteps approach]

DR. MARTINEZ (soft, concerned) (places coffee on table) Drink. It's been a long night for everyone.

JULIA (whispers) I know. (pauses, wipes tears) But it's not any easier.

DR. MARTINEZ (reassuring) Julia, you've done everything you could. (pauses, approaches) Sometimes, it's out of our hands.

JULIA (nods, sighs) Thanks, Dr. Martinez. (pauses, stands up) I'll be okay.

=== SCENE 4: INT. TOM'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING ===
[SFX: alarm_clock_rings, traffic_sounds, door_slams, footsteps_approach, phone_ringing]

LENA (O.S., professional) Tom, you're here early.

TOM (serious, determined) (closes office door, lowers voice) Those messages you logged yesterday... (pauses as phone buzzes, ignores it)

[SFX: phone_rings_intensely]

LENA (concerned) What's that mean?

TOM (explains) The system's been sending messages, but they're not reaching the intended recipient. I don't know why, but I'm going to find out.

LENA (nodding) Okay, let's go through the logs. Maybe we can trace the issue.

TOM (resolute) Thanks, Lena. I owe this to Julia.

=== SCENE 5: INT. TOM'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON ===
[SFX: ambient_office, keyboard_tapping, paper_rustling]

LENA (O.S., focused) Tom, look at this! I've found a pattern in the logs. (keyboard_tapping_faster) The messages aren't just failing—there's some kind of redirection happening in the system. (voice drops) It's almost like they're being sent somewhere else first.

TOM (shocked, stands up) What? How is that possible? (knocks over coffee cup) Damn it! (grabs jacket) This could be a major security breach. We need to protect the system before someone gets hurt!

[SFX: computer_alerts, rapid_keyboarding]

LENA (nodding) I agree. I'll run a trace on the unknown address. (typing_faster) It might take some—

TOM (interrupting) (grabs jacket, checks watch) Julia's shift ends in two hours.

[SFX: urgent_phone_rings]

LENA (determined) I'll do whatever—yes, whatever it takes. Let's get to work.

=== SCENE 6: INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - AFTERNOON ===
[SFX: ambulance_sirens_approaching, hospital_doors_burst_open, gurney_wheels, urgent_voices]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia. Critical case. Stat!

[SFX: rapid_footsteps_approach]

JULIA (determined, professional) (rolls up sleeves, pauses at unfamiliar scar on arm, then clenches fist) Ready when you are.

[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia's quick movements, monitor_beeps_rapidly]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., calm but urgent) Good. Stay focused, Julia. Pressure's dropping!

[SFX: urgent_equipment_beeps]

JULIA (focused) I'm ready. (commanding) Clamp! Now! Let's save this patient.
