Hi, Tom. Sarah here. Sorry to call so early, but I need to reschedule. Something came up.

I'm here for you, Sarah. What's been going on? Are you expecting an important message?

SARAH (O.S., hesitant)
I think it's the stress at work. My boss is really pushing me, and I feel overwhelmed.

That's a lot. Setting boundaries is key. Take care of yourself. Have you tried any of the techniques we discussed?

I've been trying the deep breathing, but it's hard to focus.
