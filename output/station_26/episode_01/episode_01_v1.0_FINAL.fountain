[SFX: Distant sirens, creaking metal, faint echo of dripping water, a distant whisper of wind]

JACK: (whispering, eyes darting around) Did you check the back door?

LUCY: (nodding, her voice tense) Clear. But I heard something.

JACK: (tense, stepping closer) What was it? Was it inside?

LUCY: (shaking head, her voice trembling) Not sure. Maybe a rat. But it sounded... different. Like it was watching us.

JACK: (sighs, rubbing his temples) Let's just get this over with. I don't like the vibe in this place. (pauses, looking around) It's like the walls are closing in.

LUCY: (nodding, her hand on her sidearm) I know. I can feel it too. (whispers) We need to be careful. (pauses, her eyes narrowing) Do you think they know we're here?

JACK: (shakes his head, his voice low) I don't know. But we can't afford to make any mistakes. (pauses, taking a deep breath) Let's split up. I'll take the left side, you take the right. Meet back here in ten.

LUCY: (nods, her voice steady) Got it. (pauses, looking at him) Be careful, Jack.

JACK: (nods, his expression serious) Always. (they part ways, the sound of their footsteps fading into the echoing silence)

JACK: (urgent, his voice low) I found something. It's... (pauses, looking around nervously) I think it might be important. Meet me there. Over.

LUCY: (concerned, her voice firm) On my way. (pauses, her hand tightening on her weapon) Be careful. Over.

JACK: (nods, though she can't see) Always. (pauses, his mind racing) I'll be waiting. (cuts the transmission, his eyes narrowing as he remembers a similar night years ago, the sound of footsteps and a whisper of a memory)

JACK: (whispering back, his voice low) Over here. (points to a pile of crates, his eyes scanning the dark corners)

LUCY: (nodding, her hand on her weapon) What did you find?

JACK: (showing her a small device, his voice tense) This. It's a tracking device. (pauses, his eyes narrowing) They're watching us. (pauses, his mind racing) We need to figure out who planted it and why.

LUCY: (frowning, her eyes wide) How long has it been here?

JACK: (shakes his head, his voice low) I don't know. But it's been active for at least a few days. (pauses, looking at her) We need to be careful. (pauses, his voice softening) I don't want to put you in danger.

LUCY: (nods, her voice firm) I can handle it. (pauses, her hand tightening on the device) We need to find out who's behind this. (pauses, her eyes meeting his) We're in this together, Jack. (pauses, a distant memory of a similar moment flashing through her mind)

LUCY: (into radio, her voice steady but with a hint of worry) Copy that. I'm checking the back. Over. (pauses, her eyes scanning the dark corridors) I'll be there in a minute.

JACK: (nodding, his eyes fixed on the monitors) Roger that. (pauses, his voice low) I think I see something. (pauses, his finger hovering over a key) It's a live feed from a camera outside. (pauses, his eyes narrowing) It looks like someone's approaching.

LUCY: (concerned, her voice urgent) What is it? Over. (pauses, her hand on her weapon) I'm on my way.

JACK: (nods, his voice low) Be careful. (pauses, his mind racing) I'll keep an eye on the monitors. (pauses, his eyes darting to a corner of the room where a faint shadow moves) I don't like this. (pauses, his voice low) We need to be ready for anything.
