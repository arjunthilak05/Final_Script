How about 3 PM instead?\n\nSARAH (O.S., hesitant)\n3 PM could work. I'll have to check my schedule and confirm later. Things are just... complicated right now.\n\nTOM\n(sympathetic)\nOf course.

It's helping.\n\nNURSE LINDA\n(sympathetic)\nYou look like you could use a break. Want to chat?\n\nJULIA\n(appreciative)\nI'd like that, but I should probably get back to work. We have a critical case coming in soon.\n\nNURSE LINDA\n(concerned)\nYou sure you're up for it?\n\nJULIA\n(determined)\nI have to be. It's part of the job.\n\nNURSE LINDA\n(encouraging)\nYou're one of the best, Julia. You've got this.\n\nJULIA\n(smiling, grateful)\nThanks, Linda.

It's Sarah. I... I'm really struggling today. I keep checking my phone, waiting for... something.\n\nTOM\n(concerned, leaning forward)\nI'm here for you, Sarah. What's been going on? (pauses, his voice softening) Are you expecting an important message? (notices her hesitation) Sometimes it helps to talk about it, even if it feels overwhelming.\n\nSARAH (O.S., hesitant)\nI think it's the stress at work. My boss is really pushing me, and I feel overwhelmed.\n\nTOM\n(kindly)\nThat's a lot to handle. It's important to set boundaries and take care of yourself. Have you tried any of the techniques we discussed?\n\nSARAH (O.S., hopeful)\nI've been trying the deep breathing, but it's hard to focus.\n\nTOM\n(gentle, guiding)\nThat's totally normal. Let's try a guided meditation. It might help you center yourself.\n\n[SFX: Tom's phone plays a soft, calming meditation audio.]\n\nTOM\n(gentle, guiding)\nTake a deep breath in... and out... In... and out...\n\n[SFX: Sarah's breathing becomes more relaxed.]\n\nSARAH (O.S., calmer)\nI feel a bit better. Thank you, Tom.\n\nTOM\n(smiling, warm)\nAnytime, Sarah. Remember, you're not alone.
