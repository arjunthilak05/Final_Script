=== SCENE 1: INT. TOM'S APARTMENT - EVENING ===
[SFX: ambient_apartment, distant_traffic, light_rain]

TOM (thinking aloud, pacing, running a hand through his hair) Why isn't she getting the messages? I've checked the system, everything looks good. It's like they're just disappearing into thin air. (sighs deeply, his breath visible in the cool evening air) (glances at his computer screen showing a message interface with unusual error codes, his eyes narrowing in frustration) This is impossible. (pauses, looking around his cluttered apartment, a half-empty pizza box on the table, a stack of unread medical journals by the couch) I should have been there. I promised her. (sighs again, his voice barely above a whisper) Julia, I need to find out what's happening.

[SFX: phone_vibrates urgently, Tom stops pacing]

TOM (answering) Hello? (pauses, concerned) What do you mean she's not responding? (frustrated, slams fist on table) I've been sending messages all day! (hangs up, muttering) It's gotta be a glitch. But what if it's something more? (paces quickly to window) Julia, I swear I'll find out what's happening.

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we need to intubate now! Her oxygen levels are dropping.

[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia's quick movements]

JULIA (strained, focused, her voice steady despite the tension) I'm in position. Here we go! (pauses, her eyes briefly flicking to the observation window where she notices a familiar-looking face, a flash of recognition in her eyes, but she quickly shakes it off) No time for distractions. (focuses back on the patient, her hands steady but her heart racing) (notices a distinctive ring on the patient's finger that looks familiar, her breath hitching) (forces herself to concentrate) I can do this. (takes a deep breath, her voice firm) Let's save this patient.

[SFX: door_opens, footsteps_approach]

MIKE (O.S., calm) Good, good. Keep going, Julia.

[SFX: heart_monitor_beep_accelerates, Julia's breathing, equipment_beeps]

[SFX: heart_monitor_stabilizes]

[SFX: door_opens, footsteps_approach]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., relieved) Great work, everyone. Julia, you did well.

JULIA (whispers, to herself, notices a distinctive ring on the patient's finger) I... I couldn't save her. (hands trembling, notices a distinctive ring on the patient's finger that looks familiar, walks away quickly)

[SFX: pager_beeps urgently]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., urgent) Julia, we need you in trauma room 2, stat!

=== SCENE 3: INT. HOSPITAL STAFF ROOM - LATE NIGHT ===
[SFX: ambient_hospital, faint_heart_monitor, soft_crying]

JULIA (whispering, to herself, her voice breaking, stares at the photo of a young woman on the wall, a faded Polaroid with a handwritten note on the back) Why couldn't I save her? (pauses, a tear sliding down her cheek, her hand trembling as she reaches out to touch the photo) I promised I'd always be there. (looks at a photo on her phone of a young woman, the same one, but with a more recent image, a smile on her face) (sighs, her voice barely audible) I should have been stronger. (wipes the tear, her eyes reflecting the harsh fluorescent light of the staff room) I should have known. (stares at the photo, her resolve hardening) I won't let this happen again.

[SFX: clock_ticks loudly, Julia sobs]

JULIA (wipes tears) I should have done more.

[SFX: door_creaks, footsteps approach]

DR. MARTINEZ (soft, concerned) Julia, you did everything you could. (pauses, approaches) Sometimes, it's out of our hands.

JULIA (whispers) I know. (pauses, wipes tears) But it doesn't make it any easier.

DR. MARTINEZ (reassuring) You're one of the best doctors I know. Don't doubt yourself.

JULIA (nods, sighs) Thanks, Dr. Martinez. (pauses, stands up) I'll be okay.

=== SCENE 4: INT. TOM'S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING ===
[SFX: alarm_clock_rings, traffic_sounds, door_slams, footsteps_approach, phone_ringing]

LENA (O.S., professional, her voice tinged with concern) Tom, you're here early. (pauses, her eyes narrowing as she notices the dark circles under his eyes and the tension in his shoulders) You look like you haven't slept. (steps closer, her voice softer) What's going on?

[SFX: phone_vibrates]

TOM (serious, determined) Lena, we need to talk. I made a mistake with the messages. (glances at his phone nervously) I didn't realize how critical it was until last night when—

(SFX: phone_rings_intensely)

LENA (concerned) What do you mean?

TOM (explains) The system's been sending messages, but they're not reaching the intended recipient. I don't... I don't know why, but I'm going to find out.

LENA (nodding) Okay, let's go through the logs. Maybe we can trace the issue.

TOM (resolute) Thanks, Lena. I owe this to Julia.

[SFX: ambient_office, keyboard_tapping, paper_rustling]

LENA (O.S., focused, her voice urgent as she leans over the computer, her fingers flying over the keyboard) Tom, look at this! (points to the screen, her eyes wide) I've found a pattern in the logs. (keyboard_tapping_faster, the sound of her typing echoing in the quiet office) The messages aren't just failing—there's some kind of redirection happening in the system. (voice drops, her eyes narrowing) It's almost like they're being sent somewhere else first. (pauses, looking at Tom, her voice filled with concern) This could be a major security breach. (shakes her head) I can't believe we didn't catch this sooner. (looks back at the screen, her determination evident) We need to act fast.

TOM (shocked, stands up) What? How is that possible? (knocks over coffee cup) Damn it! (grabs jacket) This could be a major security breach. We need to protect the system before someone gets hurt!

[SFX: computer_alerts, rapid_keyboarding]

LENA (determined) I agree. I'll run a trace on the unknown address. (typing_faster) It might take some—

TOM (interrupting) We don't have time! (leans over desk) Julia's life could be in danger.

LENA (determined) I'll do whatever it takes. (typing) Let's get to work.

[SFX: rapid_footsteps_approach]

JULIA (determined, professional, her eyes focused on the task at hand, her voice steady despite the chaos around her) I'm ready. (notices a small scar on her arm, a reminder of a past trauma, but pushes the thought aside) (commanding, her voice cutting through the urgency) Clamp! Now! Let's save this patient. (pauses, her eyes meeting Dr. Martinez's for a brief moment, a silent understanding passing between them) (focuses back on the task, her hands moving with precision) We can do this.

[SFX: medical_equipment_whirring, Julia's quick movements, monitor_beeps_rapidly]

DR. MARTINEZ (O.S., calm but urgent) Good. Stay focused, Julia. Pressure's dropping!

[SFX: urgent_equipment_beeps]
