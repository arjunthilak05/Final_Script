    "executive_summary": "The analysis of the current session reveals a significant limitation in evaluating emotional truth and narrative development. The single episode processed consists entirely of placeholder text, which prevents meaningful assessment of emotional arcs, character relationships, and universal resonance. Without actual content, it's impossible to determine the emotional health of the narrative or provide insights into character development and audience engagement potential.",

Once genuine scripts are generated, consistency should be assessed across character development, relationship evolution, and thematic resonance. Regular emotional truth validation should be implemented as part of the content development process."
