EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The audio clarity analysis across three episodes reveals significant challenges in establishing clear auditory environments and character contexts. Episode 2 scored the lowest at 32, showing critical issues in character introduction and spatial context, while Episode 1 performed best at 56, though still lacking in emotional cues and movement descriptions. Common problems include insufficient sound design to establish locations, unclear character positioning, and missing contextual information that would help listeners understand character relationships and motivations.

AUDIO OPTIMIZATION RECOMMENDATIONS
----------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a consistent sound design template for each location with distinctive ambient signatures
2. Implement character positioning indicators at the start of each scene to establish spatial relationships
3. Add emotional sound cues (sighs, footsteps, object interactions) to enhance character presence
4. Establish clear audio bridges between scenes using transitional sounds (footsteps, doors, environmental changes)
5. Review all dialogue openings to ensure sufficient context for new listeners or after breaks
