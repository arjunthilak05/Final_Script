## Executive Summary

The world consistency across the three episodes shows a solid foundation with several areas requiring improvement. The physical world, social systems, and historical continuity maintain high scores, indicating good adherence to established world rules. However, there are notable issues with location specificity, audio signature implementation, and character knowledge context that affect the overall consistency. The world bible provides a detailed framework for locations and their sonic signatures, but the episodes don't always leverage these established elements effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how spaces are represented and experienced by the audience.

## Critical Violations


## Major Violations


## Recommended Fixes

1. The scene is set in a living room at night but does not specify which of the established locations it represents. Consider clarifying if this is Sarah's House (which has a living room) or another location to better align with the established world geography. - Episode 1
2. Specify that the Living Room and Kitchen are part of one of the established locations, particularly Sarah's House which has both these spaces defined in its description. - Episode 2
3. Add more specific sound design notes that align with the sonic signatures of the established locations. - Episode 2
4. Consider adding more specific ambient sound design for the coffee shop scene based on the established sonic signature for the Caf√© location (loc_006) to enhance immersion. - Episode 3
