    "summary_text": "The world consistency across the three episodes shows a solid foundation with several areas requiring improvement. The physical world, social systems, and historical continuity maintain high scores, indicating good adherence to established world rules. However, there are notable issues with location specificity, audio signature implementation, and character knowledge context that affect the overall consistency. The world bible provides a detailed framework for locations and their sonic signatures, but the episodes don't always leverage these established elements effectively, leading to inconsistencies in how spaces are represented and experienced by the audience.",
