    "summary_text": "The character voice distinction across all episodes shows significant challenges with auditory differentiation. Overall uniqueness scores remain low to moderate (ranging from 28 to 58), indicating that characters lack distinctive verbal markers that would allow listeners to identify them without visual cues. The most pervasive issue is the limited dialogue in early episodes, which prevents establishing strong baseline voices. Additionally, characters tend to share similar vocabulary, speech patterns, and emotional expressions, making them easily confusable. While Episode 3 shows some improvement with Beth and Jake demonstrating slightly more distinctive voices through vocabulary choices and speech patterns, there remains substantial work needed to create clear auditory differentiation across all characters.",
