    "summary_text": "The audio hygiene analysis reveals significant deficiencies across all sound design elements in the single episode audited. Episode 01 shows a complete absence of sound effects, music, and silence cues, resulting in a script that lacks the necessary audio infrastructure for effective production. The episode demonstrates critical gaps in all major categories including SFX necessity (0%), music functionality (0%), ambience implementation (0%), and strategic silence usage (0%), indicating a fundamental lack of audio design integration at the script level. The audio landscape is essentially barren, with no cues provided for scene establishment, emotional support, or narrative enhancement through sound. This represents a foundational issue that would severely impact production quality and audience experience if not addressed immediately. The episode requires comprehensive audio design integration before proceeding to production.",
