## Overall Assessment

The plant/payoff system demonstrates exceptional narrative planning with perfect payoff execution. All 17 plants have appropriate, well-earned payoffs with clear audio callbacks and satisfying resolutions. The system shows excellent variety across character secrets, mystery clues, world-building, relationship dynamics, and thematic elements. The audio signature integration is particularly strong, creating a cohesive sensory experience that reinforces narrative connections. The only minor concern is the heavy concentration of plants in episode 01, which creates a potential front-loading of information, though this is mitigated by the excellent distribution of payoffs across subsequent episodes.

### Scores

- Plant Density: 85/100
