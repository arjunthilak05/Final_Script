# Redundancy Elimination Report

## Overall Assessment

The script shows significant redundancy issues, particularly in sound design with overused effects and music. While dialogue appears relatively clean, there are opportunities for optimization through trimming unnecessary phrases and eliminating narrator descriptions of sound effects. Scene structure has some repetitive patterns that could be consolidated. The current word count of 185,000 exceeds the target by 20,000 words, but estimated savings of 3,300 words fall short of the needed reduction, requiring more aggressive cuts.
