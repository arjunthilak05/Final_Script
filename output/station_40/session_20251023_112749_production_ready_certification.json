    "executive_summary": "The format verification across all three episodes reveals consistent issues that prevent production readiness. All episodes fail to meet required format standards, with common problems including incorrect SFX formatting, missing scene numbering, and absent runtime estimates. These issues appear systematic across the entire series, suggesting a need for standardized formatting guidelines and writer training. While production notes and documentation are complete across all episodes, the technical formatting requires immediate attention before any production can proceed.",
