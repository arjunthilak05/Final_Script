TOP CONFUSION RISK POINTS
----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Episode All - Risk Level: 10
   Description: The episodes don't match the project DNA about 'The Accidental Lifeline' story of Tom the motivation coach and Julia the ER doctor.
   Source: first_time
   Suggested Fix: Align episode content with the intended project narrative or clarify if these are placeholder episodes not representative of the final series.

2. Episode 3 - Risk Level: 10
   Description: Completely different setting (coffee shop) and characters (Beth and Jake) with no connection to the main storyline.
   Source: binge
   Suggested Fix: Focus on developing Tom and Julia's relationship through the text messages, showing how they're affecting both characters' lives.

3. Episode 3 - Risk Level: 9
   Description: Complete narrative departure with no connection to previous episodes, making the series feel disjointed.
   Source: first_time
   Suggested Fix: Establish clearer connections between episodes or provide framing that explains the anthology nature if that's the intention.

4. Episode 2 - Risk Level: 9
   Description: Introduces new characters Sara and Lucy with no connection to previous episode or main storyline.
   Source: binge
   Suggested Fix: Develop the main narrative thread about the accidental text messages and their impact on Julia's life.

5. Episode 3 - Risk Level: 9
   Description: Complete shift in characters and setting with no connection to previous episodes, making it seem like an entirely different show.
   Source: weekly
   Suggested Fix: Add substantial recap and a bridge connecting the previous narrative to this new setting, or reconsider if this episode belongs in this series.

6. Episode 2 - Risk Level: 8
   Description: Introduction of new characters without connection to episode 1, creating narrative disconnection.
   Source: first_time
   Suggested Fix: Either maintain character continuity or provide clear indication that these are different storylines within the same series.

7. Episode 1 - Risk Level: 8
   Description: Characters John and Lisa don't match the main characters Tom and Julia from project DNA. The setting doesn't match any key locations.
   Source: binge
   Suggested Fix: Align episodes with the main storyline of Tom and Julia, starting with establishing Tom as a motivation coach and Julia as an ER doctor.

8. Episode 1 - Risk Level: 7
   Description: No establishing context about who John and Lisa are, their relationship, or what they're planning to do.
   Source: first_time
   Suggested Fix: Add brief establishing narration or dialogue to provide basic context about the characters and situation.

9. Episode 2 - Risk Level: 7
   Description: Introduction of new character Sara without context, and unclear relationship to John from Episode 1.
   Source: weekly
   Suggested Fix: Add a brief recap at the beginning mentioning John and Lisa waiting for their mother, then introduce Sara's relationship to them.

10. Episode 3 - Risk Level: 7
   Description: The sudden shift to a coffee shop setting during daytime may confuse listeners who resume after interruption, as there's no clear connection to the previous nighttime scenes.
   Source: attention
   Suggested Fix: Add a brief establishing comment or sound effect that connects Episode 3 to previous episodes, or include a subtle reminder of the main characters/narrative thread.
