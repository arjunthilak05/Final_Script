LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nFADE IN:\n\n[NOTE: Add subtle phone notification sound to establish Tom's focus on his phone]\n\nNARRATOR\n[NOTE: Deliver with calm, reflective tone emphasizing the weight of the situation]\nTom stared at his phone, the realization washing over him like a tidal wave. A year of messages sent to the wrong number. A year of connection with someone he'd never met.\n\nTOM\n[NOTE: Voice trembling with disbelief - convey shock and confusion]\nHow could I have been sending messages to a stranger for a year?\n\nJULIA\n[NOTE: Voice barely audible but clear, filled with emotion - convey vulnerability and deep feeling]\nThose messages... they were the only thing keeping me grounded some days.\n\n[NOTE: CRITICAL SFX: DOOR CREAKING - must be clear but not overwhelming]\n[NOTE: Optional: Add subtle footsteps after door creaking to indicate Sarah's entrance]\n\nNARRATOR\n[NOTE: Maintain calm, reflective tone while bridging to new character]\nThe weight of the situation settled between them as Sarah entered, her business instincts immediately recognizing the extraordinary circumstances.\n\nCUT TO:\n\nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\n[NOTE: CRITICAL SFX: SUBTLE KITCHEN AMBIENCE - REFRIGERATOR HUM, DISTANT CITY TRAFFIC - should be present but not overwhelming dialogue]\n\nSARAH\n[NOTE: Pacing urgently - convey determination and business-like approach, with optional pacing footsteps]\nWe need to find out who this person is. Now.\n\nFADE OUT."
