Core Premise:
King Alexander must reconcile his personal identity with the weight of the crown after discovering a family secret that challenges his legitimacy to the throne. As political forces conspire against him, he must determine what truly makes a king worthy of ruling. The story explores whether kingship is defined by birthright, character, or the ability to lead through crisis.

Central Conflict:
King Alexander faces a brewing rebellion led by those who question his right to rule, forcing him to prove his worthiness beyond mere bloodline. As external threats to the kingdom mount, he must navigate treacherous political waters while staying true to his vision of leadership. The ultimate question becomes whether a king is defined by his title or by his actions in protecting his people.

Episode Rationale:
An 8-12 episode structure allows for thorough character development of King Alexander and those around him as he faces challenges to his rule.

Each episode can focus on different aspects of kingship while building toward a satisfying resolution of the central conflict.
