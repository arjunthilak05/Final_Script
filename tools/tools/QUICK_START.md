# Quick Start Guide - Station Creator Wizard

## For Your Customers

### What This Does
Your customers can now create custom stations for your audiobook production system **without any coding**. They just answer questions, and the AI creates everything for them.

### How to Use (3 Simple Steps)

#### 1. Run the Wizard
```bash
cd /path/to/script
python run_station_creator.py
```

#### 2. Answer Questions
The AI will ask 6 simple questions:
- What should the station be called?
- What should it do?
- What type of station is it?
- What inputs does it need?
- How complex should the AI be?
- What should it output?

After each answer, the AI shows what it generated and asks "Does this look good?"

**If it looks good:** Type `yes` and press Enter

**If you want changes:** Describe what to change in plain English
- "make it simpler"
- "add emotion detection"
- "use a faster AI model"
- etc.

#### 3. Test Your Station
After the wizard finishes:
```bash
python tools/test_station_XX.py
```
(Replace XX with your station number)

### Example Session

```
$ python run_station_creator.py

### Getting Help

1. **Read the AI's output carefully** - It explains what it created
2. **Use the test script** - Shows if everything works
3. **Check the code comments** - Generated code has explanations
4. **Try it again** - You can create unlimited stations

### Important Notes

‚ö†Ô∏è **This is for testing only** - Generated stations are separate from the main system

‚ö†Ô∏è **Test before using** - Always test your stations first

‚ö†Ô∏è **You can edit** - All generated code can be customized

### Integration Later

When you're ready to add your station to the main pipeline:
1. Test it thoroughly
2. Review and customize the code
3. Follow integration instructions in main README
4. Contact support for help
